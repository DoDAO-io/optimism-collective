## Citizens' House
 
### What is Citizens' House?

The Citizens' House is an innovative approach to governance that aims to promote fairness and inclusivity. It is a part of the Optimism Collective, working alongside the Token House to govern the collective. In its initial stage, the Citizens' House is responsible for voting on the allocation of Retroactive Public Goods Funding (RetroPGF). This funding is used to support public goods that have already been provided.

During this early phase, the Optimism Foundation takes charge of determining the scope and amount of each funding round. They also oversee the voting process. It's important to note that holding a voting badge during this stage does not guarantee permanent participation in the Citizens' House or future rounds of RetroPGF.
