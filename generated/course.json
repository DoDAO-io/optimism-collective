          "details": "### What is Optimism Collective?\n\nThe Optimism Collective is a revolutionary concept that aims to reshape the way we organize and govern ourselves in the digital age. In the current cyberspace, we face a significant market failure because the economic rules that govern it were designed for the physical world. However, cyberspace is built on information, which can be freely replicated, making public goods crucial for its growth. Unfortunately, our markets are not equipped to nurture this growth and reward the creators of these public goods for their impact.\n\nThe Optimism Collective seeks to change this by introducing a new model of digital democratic governance. It is a coalition of communities, companies, and citizens who have come together with a shared goal: to reward positive impact with profit. This principle, impact=profit, serves as their guiding light, motivating the creation of a more productive and empathetic economy. The Collective aims to dispel the misconception that public goods cannot be profitable and consistently provides retroactive incentives for public goods that benefit Optimism, Ethereum, and the Collective as a whole. The following diagram showcases the two governing bodies of Optimism Collective: \n\n<div align=\"center\">\n  <img style=\"max-height:400px;margin-bottom:30px\" src=\"https://d31h13bdjwgzxs.cloudfront.net/academy/optimism-university/Guide/optimism_collective_optimism_university_778/1695662417127_untitled-2023-09-25-1547.png\"/>\n</div>\n\n### Mechanism of OP Collective\n\nBy incentivizing the creation of public goods, the Optimism Collective propels the growth of the decentralized ecosystem. As the Collective expands, so does the scope of what falls under the umbrella of public goods. They envision a future where the Collective extends beyond the digital realm and into the physical world, reliably providing for basic human needs at scale. While this may seem idealistic today, they approach it with an overwhelming sense of optimism and a belief that it will become commonplace in the future.\n\nThe Optimism Collective operates on the belief that public goods and profitability can go hand in hand. Often, public goods are underfunded because the incentives are not properly aligned, forcing individuals and organizations to choose between profit and the common good. However, the Collective is bound by a mutually beneficial pact, where impact equals profit. They deploy a new model called retroactive public goods funding, which rewards those who create or sustain public goods. This funding mechanism is advantageous because it is easier to identify what is useful and who built it, rather than predicting future usefulness and the best team to build it.\n\nRetroactive public goods funding also encourages initial investment in public good development by offering the possibility of an eventual exit payment. This mirrors the way investors fund startups today, with the potential for an IPO or buyout. By aligning incentives and providing retroactive funding, the Optimism Collective aims to support projects and communities that are building for the common good and creating a sustainable future for Ethereum.",

          "details": "The Optimism Foundation plays a crucial role in supporting the establishment of the Optimism Collective and the development of the Optimism ecosystem. It is part of a larger network of companies, groups, and individuals working towards the realization of the Optimistic Vision. As an established entity, the Foundation has the ability to enter into legally enforceable commitments, allowing it to act quickly and safely to support the Collective in its early stages.\n\n### Governance\nOne of the key responsibilities of the Optimism Foundation is its stewardship role in facilitating various administrative aspects of Collective governance. It helps develop frameworks such as the Working Constitution and the Operating Manual, which are essential for facilitating participation within the Collective. By providing these administrative services, the Foundation ensures that the Collective operates smoothly and efficiently.\n\n<div align=\"center\">\n  <img style=\"max-height:400px;margin-bottom:30px\" src=\"https://d31h13bdjwgzxs.cloudfront.net/academy/optimism-university/Guide/optimism_collective_optimism_university_778/1695645715836_untitled-2023-09-25-1547.png\"/>\n</div>\n\n### Support Optimism Protocol\nThe Foundation also plays a vital role in supporting the Optimism protocol as an open-source project. It encourages and enables the community to contribute to the technical architecture of the protocol. Additionally, the Foundation commissions technical research on scalability, security, and decentralization, ensuring that the Optimism protocol remains robust and reliable. By supporting the development of the protocol, the Foundation contributes to the growth and success of the Optimism ecosystem.\n\n### Future Goals\nWhile the Optimism Foundation currently provides administrative services and support, its ultimate aim is to coordinate contributors in creating the technical and governance foundations that will allow for decentralization over time. The Foundation recognizes the importance of empowering the community and gradually reducing its own role. This approach ensures that the Collective becomes self-sustaining and capable of making independent decisions in the future.",

Let's take a closer look at the foundation's work processes and how they contribute to its smooth functioning:\n\n### Governing Body\nThe foundation is governed by a Board of Directors, which currently consists of Abbey Titcomb, Ben Jones, Brian Avello, Eva Beylin, and Jing. The board's primary role is to manage the foundation's business and affairs. They oversee the foundation's directors and ensure that they fulfill their legal obligations. Additionally, a supervisor is appointed to provide guidance and support to the board.\n\n<div align=\"center\">\n  <img style=\"max-height:400px;margin-bottom:30px\" src=\"https://d31h13bdjwgzxs.cloudfront.net/academy/optimism-university/Guide/optimism_collective_optimism_university_778/1695662760150_untitled-2023-09-25-1547.png\"/>\n</div>\n\n### Employment\nTo execute its operational and administrative aims, the foundation employs officers, contractors, and service providers. These individuals and entities play a crucial role in carrying out the day-to-day tasks and responsibilities of the foundation. They work closely with the board and other stakeholders to ensure the smooth functioning of the foundation.\n\n### Legal Accountability\nAs a Cayman Islands foundation company, the Optimism Foundation is legally accountable to its governing documentation. This documentation establishes the foundation's commitment to defer to the will of the Optimism Collective and its governance. The foundation is required to observe and implement the outcome of valid governance votes diligently and in a commercially reasonable manner. However, the foundation's discretion is limited to proposals that are unsafe, insecure, inconsistent with its purpose, legally non-compliant, or would hinder its ability to function effectively.",

          "details": "To ensure accountability and transparency, the foundation has implemented three governance proposal types. These proposals are designed to protect the rights of OP token holders and maintain transparency within the organization. By having these proposals in place, the foundation aims to align its financial resources with the collective's interests and priorities:\n\n### Vote for Disbursement\nThe foundation's financial resources are subject to an annual vote. This means that the amount of OP tokens available for disbursement are determined through a vote by the collective. By involving the collective in this decision-making process, the foundation ensures that its financial resources are allocated in a manner that aligns with the interests and priorities of the token holders.\n\n<div align=\"center\">\n  <img style=\"max-height:400px;margin-bottom:30px\" src=\"https://d31h13bdjwgzxs.cloudfront.net/academy/optimism-university/Guide/optimism_collective_optimism_university_778/1695645916513_untitled-2023-09-25-1547.png\"/>\n</div>\n\n### Director Removal\nThe governance has the authority to remove any member of the foundation's Board of Directors from service. This power is crucial in holding board members accountable for their actions and decisions. It allows for the removal of any director who fails to fulfill their responsibilities or acts against the best interests of the foundation. By having this authority, the governance ensures that the board members are held to a high standard and that their actions are in line with the foundation's goals.\n\n### Power to Veto\nThe Token House, representing the OP token holders, has the power to veto any proposed changes to the foundation's governing documents that would significantly reduce the rights of OP token holders. This mechanism serves as a safeguard for the interests and rights of the token holders. It ensures that their voices are heard and respected, and that any changes to the governing documents are in line with their best interests. By giving the Token House this power, the foundation demonstrates its commitment to protecting the rights of the token holders.",

      "details": "### What is Token House?\n\nToken House is an integral part of the Optimism Collective's governance structure. It was established alongside the launch of the OP token, which was distributed to addresses that demonstrated positive-sum, community-oriented behavior through Airdrop #1. \n\nThe Token House Governance Contract serves as the on-chain voting contract for all governance proposals submitted by Token House members. This is where all qualifying proposals are submitted for voting. To facilitate the voting process, the Optimism Governance Portal provides a user-friendly interface for Token House members to delegate their voting power and cast their votes on-chain.\n\n### How to become a Token House Member?\n\nThere are several avenues available for obtaining OP tokens and becoming a part of the Optimism ecosystem. One common method is through airdrops, which involve the distribution of tokens to eligible users based on specific criteria. Airdrops are frequently employed to recognize early adopters, active participants, or contributors to the project.\n\nAnother way to acquire OP tokens is through cryptocurrency trading platforms. For instance, Crypto.com offers a user-friendly platform for purchasing and trading OP tokens. By setting up an account and completing the required verification process, users gain access to the OP token market and can commence trading.\n\nFurthermore, engagement within the Optimism ecosystem presents opportunities for earning OP tokens. Individuals who contribute to the development, testing, or promotion of Optimism's technology may qualify for token rewards or incentives. Staying connected with the Optimism community and keeping abreast of the network's official communication channels enables contributors to stay informed about potential avenues for earning tokens.\n\nThe Optimism Forum plays a crucial role in the governance process by providing a platform for discussion and deliberation on governance proposals. It serves as a space where Token House members can engage in meaningful conversations and share their perspectives. In the future, additional user interfaces dedicated to governance councils may be developed to further enhance the governance experience.\n\n### Role of OP Token Holders\n\n**Participation in Decentralized Governance:** OP token holders have the opportunity to participate in the decentralized governance of the Optimism ecosystem.\n\n**Proposal Rights:** They can propose changes, updates, and enhancements to the protocol.\n\n**Voting Privileges:** OP token holders can cast votes on important matters such as protocol upgrades and fee structures.\n\n**Shaping the Network's Future:** Through their proposals and votes, they play a pivotal role in shaping the future development and direction of the Optimism network.\n\n### Proposals\n\n<div align=\"center\">\n  <img style=\"max-height:400px;margin-bottom:30px\" src=\"https://d31h13bdjwgzxs.cloudfront.net/academy/optimism-university/Guide/token_house_optimism_university_389/1695651189435_untitled-2023-09-25-1547.png\"/>\n</div>\n\nGrant proposals, known as Season 3 grant applications, are reviewed by the Grants Council and follow a separate submission process outlined in the [Grants Council: Internal Operating Procedures](https://gov.optimism.io/t/grants-council-internal-operating-procedures/4832). Non-grant proposals, on the other hand, should be posted on the [Forum](http://gov.optimism.io/) for review by the entire Optimism community. These proposals must be formatted according to the [standard proposal template](https://gov.optimism.io/t/standard-proposal-template-optimism-token-house/5443) and contain relevant information.\n\n### Voting on Proposals\n\nCurrently, voting takes place on-chain through the Governance Contract. However, the implementation of successful votes is administered by the Optimism Foundation, which may change in the future. To proceed to the voting stage, a proposal must be one of the valid proposal types and follow the specified voting process. \n\nTo move a non-grant proposal to the voting stage, it must receive explicit approval from four delegates, each holding more than 0.25% of the current votable token supply. Delegates can signal their approval by posting a specific comment on the proposal discussion thread. However, their approval does not imply an endorsement of the proposal, but rather indicates that they believe the proposal is ready for voting. Once a proposal receives four delegate approvals, the proposal author should update the title and provide a link to their proposal in the Voting Cycle Roundup thread by the last day of Week 3.\n\n### Future Submissions\n\nIf a proposal author does not receive explicit delegate approval or wishes to gather more feedback, they can continue seeking input from the community and submit an updated proposal in the next voting cycle. This ensures that proposals have ample opportunity for improvement and refinement before moving forward in the governance process.",

These cycles typically last for five weeks and serve as the primary periods for proposing, discussing, and voting on governance proposals. \n\nThese cycles commence on Thursday at 19:00 GMT (12:00 PST) and conclude on Wednesday at 19:00 GMT (12:00 PST). It is during these cycles that the community actively participates in voting on various proposals.\n\n<div align=\"center\">\n  <img style=\"max-height:400px;margin-bottom:30px\" src=\"https://d31h13bdjwgzxs.cloudfront.net/academy/optimism-university/Guide/token_house_optimism_university_389/1695651303092_untitled-2023-09-25-1547.png\"/>\n</div>\n\nReflection Periods and Special Voting Cycles are integral parts of the governance system that the Optimism Foundation follows. These cycles allow for the adoption of proposals and the modification of the collective's structure based on feedback received during the previous season. Let's delve deeper into how these cycles work.\n\n### Reflection Periods\nReflection Periods play a crucial role in the governance process. During these periods, the Optimism Foundation publishes a proposed changelog to the Operating Manual and a set of governance proposals. These proposals aim to address the feedback received in the previous season, ensuring that the collective's decisions align with the community's needs.\n\nTo allow delegates and the broader community ample time to provide critical feedback and suggestions for improvement, there are no active votes during Reflection Periods. This period serves as a dedicated time for reflection and constructive discussions, enabling the community to contribute to the enhancement of the upcoming season.\n\n### Special Voting Cycles\nFollowing the Reflection Periods, Special Voting Cycles are conducted. These cycles focus specifically on voting for proposals that aim to modify the collective's structure. It is during these cycles that the changes made during the Reflection Period are voted upon. This ensures that the collective's structure remains adaptable and responsive to the evolving needs of the community.\n\nTo stay up to date with the seasons and voting cycles, the governance calendar provides all the necessary information. It serves as a valuable resource for the community, offering insights into the timing and progression of the governance process.",

These grants are divided into three categories: Builders, Experiments, and Requests for Grants (RFGs):\n\n<div align=\"center\">\n  <img style=\"max-height:400px;margin-bottom:30px\" src=\"https://d31h13bdjwgzxs.cloudfront.net/academy/optimism-university/Guide/getting_your_project_funded_optimism_university_587/1695664570939_untitled-2023-09-25-1547.png\"/>\n</div>\n\n**Builders grants** aim to maximize the number of builders, including developers and visionaries, who are building innovative applications on Optimism. The Council is particularly interested in projects that align with their mission of advancing the Builders community. When reviewing proposals, the Council looks for information that demonstrates how the project contributes to this mission.\n\n**Experiments grants** are designed to promote the adoption of novel applications and tangible use cases on Optimism. Unlike Builders grants, these grants are intended to reach end users and are not for the use of the proposer. The proposal forms for Experiments grants are specifically designed to gather information on how the project will expand the reach of the Optimism ecosystem and enhance the adoption of useful applications.\n\n**Requests for Grants (RFGs)** represent a transitional moment in the grant process. These grants are based on the needs of the Optimism ecosystem and are issued as requests for teams to submit proposals that address the most pressing problems. The Council specifies the requirements for each request, including how to submit a proposal and how the proposals will be assessed. The RFG process is dynamic and may be updated periodically.\n\nThe Grants Council follows a five-week cycle during regular Voting Cycles to process applications. It is important to refer to the [governance calendar](https://calendar.google.com/calendar/u/0?cid=Y19mbm10Z3VoNm5vbzZxZ2JuaTJncGVyaWQ0a0Bncm91cC5jYWxlbmRhci5nb29nbGUuY29t) for the schedule and deadlines. \n\n\nThe following diagram showcases the procedure to submit a proposal:\n\n\n<div align=\"center\">\n  <img style=\"max-height:400px;margin-bottom:30px\" src=\"https://d31h13bdjwgzxs.cloudfront.net/academy/optimism-university/Guide/getting_your_project_funded_optimism_university_587/1695318790109_untitled-2023-09-21-1651.png\"/>\n</div>\n\n\n### Token House Missions\n\nThe Token House plays a crucial role in the Optimism Collective by voting on approving Missions. These Missions are specific initiatives that align with the Collective Intents and can receive grants. You can propose a Mission under Intent #1, Intent #3, or Intent #4. All proposals under Intent #2 should be grant applications that will be processed by the Grants Council. The Token House votes on these Missions once per Season, which is roughly every four to six months. In Season 4, the Foundation has suggested Intent Budgets to align the community around Collective Intents. Let's explore the different Intents and their proposed budgets:\n\n<div align=\"center\">\n  <img style=\"max-height:400px;margin-bottom:30px\" src=\"https://d31h13bdjwgzxs.cloudfront.net/academy/optimism-university/Guide/getting_your_project_funded_optimism_university_587/1695320088654_untitled-2023-09-20-1744.png\"/>\n</div>\n\n\nOne can apply by submitting a [Mission proposal](https://gov.optimism.io/t/proposed-mission-template/5882) on the forum requesting the grant amount that corresponds to their Trust Tier. Mission Proposals will be approval ranked by the Token House every six months. ",

It is a part of the Optimism Collective, working alongside the Token House to govern the collective. In its initial stage, the Citizens' House is responsible for voting on the allocation of Retroactive Public Goods Funding (RetroPGF). This funding is used to support public goods that have already been provided.\n\nDuring this early phase, the Optimism Foundation takes charge of determining the scope and amount of each funding round. They also oversee the voting process. It's important to note that holding a voting badge during this stage does not guarantee permanent participation in the Citizens' House or future rounds of RetroPGF.\n\n<div align=\"center\">\n  <img style=\"max-height:400px;margin-bottom:30px\" src=\"https://d31h13bdjwgzxs.cloudfront.net/academy/optimism-university/Guide/citizens_house_optimism_university_635/1695744433503_untitled-2023-09-26-2024.png\"/>\n</div>\n\n### Role & Responsibilities\n\n**Collaboration with Token House:** The Citizens' House collaborates with the Token House to make decisions regarding the allocation of surplus protocol revenue. This collaboration ensures a balanced governance system.\n\n**Defining Participation Criteria:** The Citizens' House plays a role in defining the criteria for participation in the governance process, ensuring that those involved meet certain requirements or standards.\n\n**Enforcement of Codes of Conduct:** It ensures adherence to the Collective's Codes of Conduct, helping maintain a respectful and ethical environment within the governance system.\n\n**RetroPGF Rounds:** The Citizens' House is closely associated with RetroPGF rounds, which follow a predefined process involving phases such as scoping, nominations, profile creation, voting, and disbursements.\n\n**KYC Procedures:** The Foundation performs Know Your Customer (KYC) procedures as part of the grant distribution process, ensuring transparency and compliance with regulatory requirements.",

          "details": "### How to Become a Citizen?\n\nBecoming a citizen is an important process that involves being recognized as a member of a particular community or country. In the context of the Citizens' House, citizenship is based on identity and aligning with the values of the Collective. This is different from the more common practice of token-voting governance. \n\nTo start the process of becoming a citizen in the Citizens' House, participants are given temporary badges that allow them to vote in RetroPGF rounds. These rounds serve as a way for individuals to have a say in the decision-making process of the Collective. However, holding a voting badge does not guarantee permanent citizenship, as membership is determined by governance and may change over time. \n\nThe Citizens' House works in collaboration with the Token House to establish criteria for participation in the Citizens' House. This means that the requirements for citizenship may evolve and be determined by the collective governance of the community. The AttestationStation contract plays a crucial role in this process, as it is a neutral and permissionless contract that is used to determine the set of citizens based on reputation data.\n\n### Number of Citizens\n\nThe number of citizens responsible for voting keeps on increasing in every RetroPGF round as depicted in the diagram below:\n\n<div align=\"center\">\n  <img style=\"max-height:400px;margin-bottom:30px\" src=\"https://d31h13bdjwgzxs.cloudfront.net/academy/optimism-university/Guide/citizens_house_optimism_university_635/1695744978005_untitled-2023-09-26-2024.png\"/>\n</div>\n\n### Citizenship - Now & Future\n\nThe current phase of Citizens' House governance is seeing an increase in the number of voting badges with each round of RetroPGF. This shows that the community is growing and more individuals are being given the opportunity to participate in the decision-making process. However, it is important to note that voting in a specific round does not guarantee permanent participation in the Citizens' House or future iterations of RetroPGF.\n\nIn the future, the goal is to have a widely distributed citizenship across the Optimism ecosystem. This means that individuals from various subcultures and industries will have the opportunity to become citizens and contribute their expertise to the community. However, it is also important to recognize that the criteria for citizenship may change as the governance of the community evolves.\n",

          "details": "### Retroactive Public Goods Funding\n\nRetroPGF, is an initiative that aims to provide financial support for public goods that are developed and utilized within the Optimism Stack (OP Stack). The idea behind RetroPGF is to reward builders who make a positive impact on the community by allowing them to profit from their contributions. It questions the purpose of building free software for the public good if there is no merit or benefit for the builder themselves. \n\nThe funding provided through RetroPGF is given to projects, companies, communities, or other entities that have already proven their value to the Optimism ecosystem. This approach is taken because it is easier to identify projects that have been useful in the past, rather than predicting their future usefulness. By rewarding projects that have already demonstrated their usefulness, RetroPGF ensures better capital allocation and encourages the development of public goods that have a tangible impact.\n\n<div align=\"center\">\n  <img style=\"max-height:400px;margin-bottom:30px\" src=\"https://d31h13bdjwgzxs.cloudfront.net/academy/optimism-university/Guide/citizens_house_optimism_university_635/1695747221046_untitled-2023-09-26-2024.png\"/>\n</div>\n\n### RetroPGF Round 1\n\nThe Optimism Collective conducted its first round of Retroactive Public Goods Funding (RetroPGF) in the fourth quarter of 2021. This round aimed to allocate $1 million to fund projects that have provided value to the Optimistic Ethereum ecosystem. A total of 76 projects were nominated, and 58 of them received funding from the badgeholders. The median funding received by a project in RetroPGF 1 was $14,670, while the top 10% of projects received more than $36,919.\n\nThe process for RetroPGF Round 1 involved two main stages: badgeholder selection and voting. In this round, 24 badgeholders, consisting of 8 Optimists and 16 Ethereum community members, were chosen to vote on distributing retrofunding to the nominated projects. Anyone could nominate a project during the nomination period by providing the project name, project lead name, project lead email, and impact description. The badgeholders were then provided with a manual and asked to evaluate and vote on the nominated projects.\n\n### RetroPGF Round 2\n\nThe Optimism Collective's second round of Retroactive Public Goods Funding took place in the first quarter of 2023. This time, RetroPGF 2 allocated 10 million OP tokens to fund public goods that support the development and usage of the OP Stack. The goal of RetroPGF is to build a global system where positive impact to the collective is rewarded by profit to the individual. In this round, all 195 nominated people and projects were awarded funding by the badgeholders.\n\nThe badgeholders played a crucial role in distributing the OP tokens to the projects. For RetroPGF Round 2, badgeholders were selected based on their participation in the previous round, through nomination by Optimism's Token House, and by nomination from other badgeholders. The nomination period allowed anyone to nominate a project by providing its name, impact description, and a link to Github/Twitter. Projects then had to create a profile with general information and a description of their project and its impact.\n\n### RetroPGF Round 3\n\nThe third round of Retroactive Public Goods Funding, RetroPGF 3 has commenced in the fall of 2023. This round will allocate 30 million OP tokens to reward contributions that have supported the development and adoption of Optimism. RetroPGF is open to all types of contributors to the Optimism ecosystem, including developers, educators, artists, creators, writers, builders, and evangelists.\n\nTo be eligible for RetroPGF, your work should have made an impact in one of the four categories: OP Stack, Collective Governance, Developer Ecosystem, and End User Experience & Adoption. Whether you have enhanced the efficiency and security of the OP Stack, provided impact to governance participants or application developers, or contributed to the end user experience and adoption, you can submit an application for RetroPGF. Voting badges for Round 3 have been distributed to 208 community members. \n\nRetroPGF aims to fund projects that contribute to the growth and success of the Optimism ecosystem, creating a rich ecosystem and a better economy for all.",
