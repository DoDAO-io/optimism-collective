          "details": "### What is Optimism Collective?\n\nThe Optimism Collective is a revolutionary concept that aims to reshape the way we organize and govern ourselves in the digital age. In the current cyberspace, we face a significant market failure because the economic rules that govern it were designed for the physical world. However, cyberspace is built on information, which can be freely replicated, making public goods crucial for its growth. Unfortunately, our markets are not equipped to nurture this growth and reward the creators of these public goods for their impact.\n\nThe Optimism Collective seeks to change this by introducing a new model of digital democratic governance. It is a coalition of communities, companies, and citizens who have come together with a shared goal: to reward positive impact with profit. This principle, impact=profit, serves as their guiding light, motivating the creation of a more productive and empathetic economy. The Collective aims to dispel the misconception that public goods cannot be profitable and consistently provides retroactive incentives for public goods that benefit Optimism, Ethereum, and the Collective as a whole. The following diagram showcases the two governing bodies of Optimism Collective: \n\n<div align=\"center\">\n  <img style=\"max-height:400px;margin-bottom:30px\" src=\"https://d31h13bdjwgzxs.cloudfront.net/academy/optimism-university/Guide/optimism_collective_optimism_university_778/1695662417127_untitled-2023-09-25-1547.png\"/>\n</div>\n\n### Mechanism of OP Collective\n\nBy incentivizing the creation of public goods, the Optimism Collective propels the growth of the decentralized ecosystem. As the Collective expands, so does the scope of what falls under the umbrella of public goods. They envision a future where the Collective extends beyond the digital realm and into the physical world, reliably providing for basic human needs at scale. While this may seem idealistic today, they approach it with an overwhelming sense of optimism and a belief that it will become commonplace in the future.\n\nThe Optimism Collective operates on the belief that public goods and profitability can go hand in hand. Often, public goods are underfunded because the incentives are not properly aligned, forcing individuals and organizations to choose between profit and the common good. However, the Collective is bound by a mutually beneficial pact, where impact equals profit. They deploy a new model called retroactive public goods funding, which rewards those who create or sustain public goods. This funding mechanism is advantageous because it is easier to identify what is useful and who built it, rather than predicting future usefulness and the best team to build it.\n\nRetroactive public goods funding also encourages initial investment in public good development by offering the possibility of an eventual exit payment. This mirrors the way investors fund startups today, with the potential for an IPO or buyout. By aligning incentives and providing retroactive funding, the Optimism Collective aims to support projects and communities that are building for the common good and creating a sustainable future for Ethereum.",

          "shortTitle": "Optimism Foundation",
          "details": "The Optimism Foundation plays a crucial role in supporting the establishment of the Optimism Collective and the development of the Optimism ecosystem. It is part of a larger network of companies, groups, and individuals working towards the realization of the Optimistic Vision. As an established entity, the Foundation has the ability to enter into legally enforceable commitments, allowing it to act quickly and safely to support the Collective in its early stages.\n\n### Governance\nOne of the key responsibilities of the Optimism Foundation is its stewardship role in facilitating various administrative aspects of Collective governance. It helps develop frameworks such as the Working Constitution and the Operating Manual, which are essential for facilitating participation within the Collective. By providing these administrative services, the Foundation ensures that the Collective operates smoothly and efficiently.\n\n<div align=\"center\">\n  <img style=\"max-height:400px;margin-bottom:30px\" src=\"https://d31h13bdjwgzxs.cloudfront.net/academy/optimism-university/Guide/optimism_collective_optimism_university_778/1695645715836_untitled-2023-09-25-1547.png\"/>\n</div>\n\n### Support Optimism Protocol\nThe Foundation also plays a vital role in supporting the Optimism protocol as an open-source project. It encourages and enables the community to contribute to the technical architecture of the protocol. Additionally, the Foundation commissions technical research on scalability, security, and decentralization, ensuring that the Optimism protocol remains robust and reliable. By supporting the development of the protocol, the Foundation contributes to the growth and success of the Optimism ecosystem.\n\n### Future Goals\nWhile the Optimism Foundation currently provides administrative services and support, its ultimate aim is to coordinate contributors in creating the technical and governance foundations that will allow for decentralization over time. The Foundation recognizes the importance of empowering the community and gradually reducing its own role. This approach ensures that the Collective becomes self-sustaining and capable of making independent decisions in the future.",
