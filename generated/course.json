      "details": "### What is Optimism Collective?\n\nThe Optimism Collective is a revolutionary concept that aims to reshape the way we organize and govern ourselves in the digital age. In the current cyberspace, we face a significant market failure because the economic rules that govern it were designed for the physical world. However, cyberspace is built on information, which can be freely replicated, making public goods crucial for its growth. Unfortunately, our markets are not equipped to nurture this growth and reward the creators of these public goods for their impact.\n\nThe Optimism Collective seeks to change this by introducing a new model of digital democratic governance. It is a coalition of communities, companies, and citizens who have come together with a shared goal: to reward positive impact with profit. This principle, impact=profit, serves as their guiding light, motivating the creation of a more productive and empathetic economy. The Collective aims to dispel the misconception that public goods cannot be profitable and consistently provides retroactive incentives for public goods that benefit Optimism, Ethereum, and the Collective as a whole. The following diagram showcases the two governing bodies of Optimism Collective: \n\n<div align=\"center\">\n  <img style=\"max-height:400px;margin-bottom:30px\" src=\"https://d31h13bdjwgzxs.cloudfront.net/academy/optimism-university/Guide/optimism_collective_optimism_university_778/1696853494210_untitled-2023-09-21-1651.png\"/>\n</div>\n\n### Mechanism of OP Collective\n\nBy incentivizing the creation of public goods, the Optimism Collective propels the growth of the decentralized ecosystem. As the Collective expands, so does the scope of what falls under the umbrella of public goods. They envision a future where the Collective extends beyond the digital realm and into the physical world, reliably providing for basic human needs at scale. While this may seem idealistic today, they approach it with an overwhelming sense of optimism and a belief that it will become commonplace in the future.\n\nThe Optimism Collective operates on the belief that public goods and profitability can go hand in hand. Often, public goods are underfunded because the incentives are not properly aligned, forcing individuals and organizations to choose between profit and the common good. However, the Collective is bound by a mutually beneficial pact, where impact equals profit. They deploy a new model called retroactive public goods funding, which rewards those who create or sustain public goods. This funding mechanism is advantageous because it is easier to identify what is useful and who built it, rather than predicting future usefulness and the best team to build it.\n\nRetroactive public goods funding also encourages initial investment in public good development by offering the possibility of an eventual exit payment. This mirrors the way investors fund startups today, with the potential for an IPO or buyout. By aligning incentives and providing retroactive funding, the Optimism Collective aims to support projects and communities that are building for the common good and creating a sustainable future for Ethereum.",

      "details": "### What is Token House?\n\nToken House is an integral part of the Optimism Collective's governance structure. It was established alongside the launch of the OP token, which was distributed to addresses that demonstrated positive-sum, community-oriented behavior through Airdrop #1. \n\nThe Token House Governance Contract serves as the on-chain voting contract for all governance proposals submitted by Token House members. This is where all qualifying proposals are submitted for voting. To facilitate the voting process, the Optimism Governance Portal provides a user-friendly interface for Token House members to delegate their voting power and cast their votes on-chain.\n\n### How to become a Token House Member?\n\nThere are several avenues available for obtaining OP tokens and becoming a part of the Optimism ecosystem. One common method is through airdrops, which involve the distribution of tokens to eligible users based on specific criteria. Airdrops are frequently employed to recognize early adopters, active participants, or contributors to the project.\n\nAnother way to acquire OP tokens is through cryptocurrency trading platforms. For instance, Crypto.com offers a user-friendly platform for purchasing and trading OP tokens. By setting up an account and completing the required verification process, users gain access to the OP token market and can commence trading.\n\nFurthermore, engagement within the Optimism ecosystem presents opportunities for earning OP tokens. Individuals who contribute to the development, testing, or promotion of Optimism's technology may qualify for token rewards or incentives. Staying connected with the Optimism community and keeping abreast of the network's official communication channels enables contributors to stay informed about potential avenues for earning tokens.\n\nThe Optimism Forum plays a crucial role in the governance process by providing a platform for discussion and deliberation on governance proposals. It serves as a space where Token House members can engage in meaningful conversations and share their perspectives. In the future, additional user interfaces dedicated to governance councils may be developed to further enhance the governance experience.\n\n### Role of OP Token Holders\n\n**Participation in Decentralized Governance:** OP token holders have the opportunity to participate in the decentralized governance of the Optimism ecosystem.\n\n**Proposal Rights:** They can propose changes, updates, and enhancements to the protocol.\n\n**Voting Privileges:** OP token holders can cast votes on important matters such as protocol upgrades and fee structures.\n\n**Shaping the Network's Future:** Through their proposals and votes, they play a pivotal role in shaping the future development and direction of the Optimism network.\n\n### Proposals\n\n<div align=\"center\">\n  <img style=\"max-height:400px;margin-bottom:30px\" src=\"https://d31h13bdjwgzxs.cloudfront.net/academy/optimism-university/Guide/token_house_optimism_university_389/1696853960292_untitled-2023-09-21-1651.png\"/>\n</div>\n\nGrant proposals, known as Season 3 grant applications, are reviewed by the Grants Council and follow a separate submission process outlined in the [Grants Council: Internal Operating Procedures](https://gov.optimism.io/t/grants-council-internal-operating-procedures/4832). Non-grant proposals, on the other hand, should be posted on the [Forum](http://gov.optimism.io/) for review by the entire Optimism community. These proposals must be formatted according to the [standard proposal template](https://gov.optimism.io/t/standard-proposal-template-optimism-token-house/5443) and contain relevant information.\n\n### Voting on Proposals\n\nCurrently, voting takes place on-chain through the Governance Contract. However, the implementation of successful votes is administered by the Optimism Foundation, which may change in the future. To proceed to the voting stage, a proposal must be one of the valid proposal types and follow the specified voting process. \n\nTo move a non-grant proposal to the voting stage, it must receive explicit approval from four delegates, each holding more than 0.25% of the current votable token supply. Delegates can signal their approval by posting a specific comment on the proposal discussion thread. However, their approval does not imply an endorsement of the proposal, but rather indicates that they believe the proposal is ready for voting. Once a proposal receives four delegate approvals, the proposal author should update the title and provide a link to their proposal in the Voting Cycle Roundup thread by the last day of Week 3.\n\n### Future Submissions\n\nIf a proposal author does not receive explicit delegate approval or wishes to gather more feedback, they can continue seeking input from the community and submit an updated proposal in the next voting cycle. This ensures that proposals have ample opportunity for improvement and refinement before moving forward in the governance process.",

These grants are divided into three categories: Builders, Experiments, and Requests for Grants (RFGs):\n\n<div align=\"center\">\n  <img style=\"max-height:400px;margin-bottom:30px\" src=\"https://d31h13bdjwgzxs.cloudfront.net/academy/optimism-university/Guide/getting_your_project_funded_optimism_university_587/1696855688861_untitled-2023-09-21-1651.png\"/>\n</div>\n\n**Builders grants** aim to maximize the number of builders, including developers and visionaries, who are building innovative applications on Optimism. The Council is particularly interested in projects that align with their mission of advancing the Builders community. When reviewing proposals, the Council looks for information that demonstrates how the project contributes to this mission.\n\n**Experiments grants** are designed to promote the adoption of novel applications and tangible use cases on Optimism. Unlike Builders grants, these grants are intended to reach end users and are not for the use of the proposer. The proposal forms for Experiments grants are specifically designed to gather information on how the project will expand the reach of the Optimism ecosystem and enhance the adoption of useful applications.\n\n**Requests for Grants (RFGs)** represent a transitional moment in the grant process. These grants are based on the needs of the Optimism ecosystem and are issued as requests for teams to submit proposals that address the most pressing problems. The Council specifies the requirements for each request, including how to submit a proposal and how the proposals will be assessed. The RFG process is dynamic and may be updated periodically.\n\nThe Grants Council follows a five-week cycle during regular Voting Cycles to process applications. It is important to refer to the [governance calendar](https://calendar.google.com/calendar/u/0?cid=Y19mbm10Z3VoNm5vbzZxZ2JuaTJncGVyaWQ0a0Bncm91cC5jYWxlbmRhci5nb29nbGUuY29t) for the schedule and deadlines. \n\n\nThe following diagram showcases the procedure to submit a proposal:\n\n\n<div align=\"center\">\n  <img style=\"max-height:400px;margin-bottom:30px\" src=\"https://d31h13bdjwgzxs.cloudfront.net/academy/optimism-university/Guide/getting_your_project_funded_optimism_university_587/1696855766046_untitled-2023-09-21-1651.png\"/>\n</div>\n\n\n### Token House Missions\n\nThe Token House plays a crucial role in the Optimism Collective by voting on approving Missions. These Missions are specific initiatives that align with the Collective Intents and can receive grants. You can propose a Mission under Intent #1, Intent #3, or Intent #4. All proposals under Intent #2 should be grant applications that will be processed by the Grants Council. The Token House votes on these Missions once per Season, which is roughly every four to six months. In Season 4, the Foundation has suggested Intent Budgets to align the community around Collective Intents. Let's explore the different Intents and their proposed budgets:\n\n<div align=\"center\">\n  <img style=\"max-height:400px;margin-bottom:30px\" src=\"https://d31h13bdjwgzxs.cloudfront.net/academy/optimism-university/Guide/getting_your_project_funded_optimism_university_587/1696855863595_untitled-2023-09-21-1651.png\"/>\n</div>\n\n\nOne can apply by submitting a [Mission proposal](https://gov.optimism.io/t/proposed-mission-template/5882) on the forum requesting the grant amount that corresponds to their Trust Tier. Mission Proposals will be approval ranked by the Token House every six months. "

These seasons are organized and scheduled to facilitate decision-making and governance within the Token House ecosystem. \n\nVoting cycles are specific phases within a season during which token holders participate in the governance process. These cycles typically last for five weeks and serve as the primary periods for proposing, discussing, and voting on governance proposals. \n\nThese cycles commence on Thursday at 19:00 GMT (12:00 PST) and conclude on Wednesday at 19:00 GMT (12:00 PST). It is during these cycles that the community actively participates in voting on various proposals.\n\n<div align=\"center\">\n  <img style=\"max-height:400px;margin-bottom:30px\" src=\"https://d31h13bdjwgzxs.cloudfront.net/academy/optimism-university/Guide/token_house_optimism_university_389/1696854095349_untitled-2023-09-21-1651.png\"/>\n</div>\n\nReflection Periods and Special Voting Cycles are integral parts of the governance system that the Optimism Foundation follows. These cycles allow for the adoption of proposals and the modification of the collective's structure based on feedback received during the previous season. Let's delve deeper into how these cycles work.\n\n### Reflection Periods\nReflection Periods play a crucial role in the governance process. During these periods, the Optimism Foundation publishes a proposed changelog to the Operating Manual and a set of governance proposals. These proposals aim to address the feedback received in the previous season, ensuring that the collective's decisions align with the community's needs.\n\nTo allow delegates and the broader community ample time to provide critical feedback and suggestions for improvement, there are no active votes during Reflection Periods. This period serves as a dedicated time for reflection and constructive discussions, enabling the community to contribute to the enhancement of the upcoming season.\n\n### Special Voting Cycles\nFollowing the Reflection Periods, Special Voting Cycles are conducted. These cycles focus specifically on voting for proposals that aim to modify the collective's structure. It is during these cycles that the changes made during the Reflection Period are voted upon. This ensures that the collective's structure remains adaptable and responsive to the evolving needs of the community.\n\nTo stay up to date with the seasons and voting cycles, the governance calendar provides all the necessary information. It serves as a valuable resource for the community, offering insights into the timing and progression of the governance process."

This shows that the community is growing and more individuals are being given the opportunity to participate in the decision-making process. However, it is important to note that voting in a specific round does not guarantee permanent participation in the Citizens' House or future iterations of RetroPGF.\n\nIn the future, the goal is to have a widely distributed citizenship across the Optimism ecosystem. This means that individuals from various subcultures and industries will have the opportunity to become citizens and contribute their expertise to the community. However, it is also important to recognize that the criteria for citizenship may change as the governance of the community evolves."

          "details": "### Retroactive Public Goods Funding\n\nRetroPGF, is an initiative that aims to provide financial support for public goods that are developed and utilized within the Optimism Stack (OP Stack). The idea behind RetroPGF is to reward builders who make a positive impact on the community by allowing them to profit from their contributions. It questions the purpose of building free software for the public good if there is no merit or benefit for the builder themselves. \n\nThe funding provided through RetroPGF is given to projects, companies, communities, or other entities that have already proven their value to the Optimism ecosystem. This approach is taken because it is easier to identify projects that have been useful in the past, rather than predicting their future usefulness. By rewarding projects that have already demonstrated their usefulness, RetroPGF ensures better capital allocation and encourages the development of public goods that have a tangible impact.\n\n<div align=\"center\">\n  <img style=\"max-height:400px;margin-bottom:30px\" src=\"https://d31h13bdjwgzxs.cloudfront.net/academy/optimism-university/Guide/citizens_house_optimism_university_635/1696855437212_untitled-2023-09-21-1651.png\"/>\n</div>\n\n### RetroPGF Round 1\n\nThe Optimism Collective conducted its first round of Retroactive Public Goods Funding (RetroPGF) in the fourth quarter of 2021. This round aimed to allocate $1 million to fund projects that have provided value to the Optimistic Ethereum ecosystem. A total of 76 projects were nominated, and 58 of them received funding from the badgeholders. The median funding received by a project in RetroPGF 1 was $14,670, while the top 10% of projects received more than $36,919.\n\nThe process for RetroPGF Round 1 involved two main stages: badgeholder selection and voting. In this round, 24 badgeholders, consisting of 8 Optimists and 16 Ethereum community members, were chosen to vote on distributing retrofunding to the nominated projects. Anyone could nominate a project during the nomination period by providing the project name, project lead name, project lead email, and impact description. The badgeholders were then provided with a manual and asked to evaluate and vote on the nominated projects.\n\n### RetroPGF Round 2\n\nThe Optimism Collective's second round of Retroactive Public Goods Funding took place in the first quarter of 2023. This time, RetroPGF 2 allocated 10 million OP tokens to fund public goods that support the development and usage of the OP Stack. The goal of RetroPGF is to build a global system where positive impact to the collective is rewarded by profit to the individual. In this round, all 195 nominated people and projects were awarded funding by the badgeholders.\n\nThe badgeholders played a crucial role in distributing the OP tokens to the projects. For RetroPGF Round 2, badgeholders were selected based on their participation in the previous round, through nomination by Optimism's Token House, and by nomination from other badgeholders. The nomination period allowed anyone to nominate a project by providing its name, impact description, and a link to Github/Twitter. Projects then had to create a profile with general information and a description of their project and its impact.\n\n### RetroPGF Round 3\n\nThe third round of Retroactive Public Goods Funding, RetroPGF 3 has commenced in the fall of 2023. This round will allocate 30 million OP tokens to reward contributions that have supported the development and adoption of Optimism. RetroPGF is open to all types of contributors to the Optimism ecosystem, including developers, educators, artists, creators, writers, builders, and evangelists.\n\nTo be eligible for RetroPGF, your work should have made an impact in one of the four categories: OP Stack, Collective Governance, Developer Ecosystem, and End User Experience & Adoption. Whether you have enhanced the efficiency and security of the OP Stack, provided impact to governance participants or application developers, or contributed to the end user experience and adoption, you can submit an application for RetroPGF. Voting badges for Round 3 have been distributed to 208 community members. \n\nRetroPGF aims to fund projects that contribute to the growth and success of the Optimism ecosystem, creating a rich ecosystem and a better economy for all."

By providing these administrative services, the Foundation ensures that the Collective operates smoothly and efficiently.\n\n<div align=\"center\">\n  <img style=\"max-height:400px;margin-bottom:30px\" src=\"https://d31h13bdjwgzxs.cloudfront.net/academy/optimism-university/Guide/optimism_collective_optimism_university_778/1696853559074_untitled-2023-09-21-1651.png\"/>\n</div>\n\n### Support Optimism Protocol\nThe Foundation also plays a vital role in supporting the Optimism protocol as an open-source project. It encourages and enables the community to contribute to the technical architecture of the protocol. Additionally, the Foundation commissions technical research on scalability, security, and decentralization, ensuring that the Optimism protocol remains robust and reliable. By supporting the development of the protocol, the Foundation contributes to the growth and success of the Optimism ecosystem.\n\n### Future Goals\nWhile the Optimism Foundation currently provides administrative services and support, its ultimate aim is to coordinate contributors in creating the technical and governance foundations that will allow for decentralization over time. The Foundation recognizes the importance of empowering the community and gradually reducing its own role. This approach ensures that the Collective becomes self-sustaining and capable of making independent decisions in the future.",

These individuals and entities play a crucial role in carrying out the day-to-day tasks and responsibilities of the foundation. They work closely with the board and other stakeholders to ensure the smooth functioning of the foundation.\n\n### Legal Accountability\nAs a Cayman Islands foundation company, the Optimism Foundation is legally accountable to its governing documentation. This documentation establishes the foundation's commitment to defer to the will of the Optimism Collective and its governance. The foundation is required to observe and implement the outcome of valid governance votes diligently and in a commercially reasonable manner. However, the foundation's discretion is limited to proposals that are unsafe, insecure, inconsistent with its purpose, legally non-compliant, or would hinder its ability to function effectively."

This mechanism serves as a safeguard for the interests and rights of the token holders. It ensures that their voices are heard and respected, and that any changes to the governing documents are in line with their best interests.

Each mission will have a specified submission and selection deadline, so make sure to take note of these dates. To apply, you can simply reply as a comment on the [RFP's Github Issue](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ecosystem-contributions/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+RFP), providing your application and any relevant information. While the Token House, a governing body, does not vote on Foundation Missions, they have visibility into all RFP applications, ensuring transparency and accountability.\n\n### Partner Fund\n\nThe Partner Fund, managed by the Optimism Foundation, is a grants program aimed at providing strategic and larger scale grants to partners who have already achieved product market fit. The primary objective of the Partner Fund is to foster the growth of Optimism's ecosystem for the benefit of the entire Collective.\n\nThe Partner Fund primarily focuses on projects that have already demonstrated success in the crypto space and are now looking to deploy and scale on the Optimism platform. These projects can be related to various areas of work, including Defi, NFTs, DAOs, and large scale usage growth for the ecosystem. By supporting these projects, the Partner Fund aims to build a thriving ecosystem for developers and users alike.\n\nThe structure of the grants falls under these two categories:\n\n<div align=\"center\">\n  <img style=\"max-height:400px;margin-bottom:30px\" src=\"https://d31h13bdjwgzxs.cloudfront.net/academy/optimism-university/Guide/getting_your_project_funded_optimism_university_587/1696856139816_untitled-2023-09-21-1651.png\"/>\n</div>\n\n**User Incentives:** Grants provided by the fund are directly distributed to users of the project on the Optimism ecosystem. This can be in the form of liquidity mining, rewards, or other user incentives. By directly involving the users, the Partner Fund ensures that the grants have a meaningful impact on the growth and adoption of the projects.\n\n**Project Grants:** Projects that receive a grant from the Partner Fund, there is a 1-year token lockup period. This means that the granted tokens cannot be immediately sold or transferred. Instead, they can be used to support the operational costs of the project. This lockup period ensures that the granted tokens are utilized in a way that aligns with the long-term objectives of the Optimism ecosystem.\n\nIt's important to note that the Optimism Foundation receives a large number of applications for the Partner Fund and can only support a select few that align with its objectives. Anyone can apply by simply filling out the [form](https://airtable.com/shrvQNlFPHGcVNqDe?prefill_Referrer=OPGov). There are no deadlines, applications are processed on a rolling basis."

One common method is through airdrops, which involve the distribution of tokens to eligible users based on specific criteria. Airdrops are frequently employed to recognize early adopters, active participants, or contributors to the project.\n\nAnother way to acquire OP tokens is through cryptocurrency trading platforms. For instance, Crypto.com offers a user-friendly platform for purchasing and trading OP tokens. By setting up an account and completing the required verification process, users gain access to the OP token market and can commence trading.\n\nFurthermore, engagement within the Optimism ecosystem presents opportunities for earning OP tokens. Individuals who contribute to the development, testing, or promotion of Optimism's technology may qualify for token rewards or incentives. Staying connected with the Optimism community and keeping abreast of the network's official communication channels enables contributors to stay informed about potential avenues for earning tokens.\n\nThe Optimism Forum plays a crucial role in the governance process by providing a platform for discussion and deliberation on governance proposals. It serves as a space where Token House members can engage in meaningful conversations and share their perspectives. In the future, additional user interfaces dedicated to governance councils may be developed to further enhance the governance experience.\n\n### Role of OP Holders\n\n<div align=\"center\">\n  <img style=\"max-height:400px;margin-bottom:30px\" src=\"https://d31h13bdjwgzxs.cloudfront.net/academy/optimism-university/Guide/optimism_holders_optimism_university_826/1696858268462_untitled-2023-09-21-1651.png\"/>\n</div>\n\n**Participation in Decentralized Governance:** OP token holders have the opportunity to participate in the decentralized governance of the Optimism ecosystem.\n\n**Proposal Rights:** They can propose changes, updates, and enhancements to the protocol.\n\n**Voting Privileges:** OP token holders can cast votes on important matters such as protocol upgrades and fee structures.\n\n**Shaping the Network's Future:** Through their proposals and votes, they play a pivotal role in shaping the future development and direction of the Optimism network.",

          "shortTitle": "Delegating Tokens",
          "details": "### Importance of Delegation\n\nParticipating in the governance of the Optimism Token House can be a time-consuming task. To address this, individuals have the option to delegate their voting power to a community member who has volunteered to actively participate in Token House governance. However, if you prefer not to delegate your voting power, you will still need to delegate to yourself in order to vote. Let's explore the process of delegating tokens:\n\nWhen trying to delegate your votes to a representative, follow this process:\n\n### Choosing Your Delegate\nDelegating your voting power is a crucial decision, so it is essential to take the time to read through delegate statements of interest. These statements provide insights into the delegate's stance on various governance matters. By carefully considering these statements, you can select a delegate who aligns with your values and priorities. Remember, a healthy governance system benefits both Optimism and all OP token holders.\n\n### Use Delegates App\nDelegating tokens to a representative allows you to transfer your voting power to someone who will actively participate in Token House governance on your behalf. By doing so, you retain 100% ownership of your tokens and can use them as you wish. To delegate your tokens, you can visit the [delegates app](https://app.optimism.io/delegates) and follow the instructions provided. It is important to note that delegate voting power is measured at the start of every voting period, which occurs every five weeks.\n\n### Delegate Communications Thread\nOnce you have delegated your tokens, your chosen delegate should provide reasoning behind their votes in a [Delegate Communications Thread](https://gov.optimism.io/c/governance/41). This thread serves as a platform for delegates to explain their decision-making process and engage with the community. By reviewing these communications, you can stay informed about the actions and decisions made on your behalf.\n\n<div align=\"center\">\n  <img style=\"max-height:400px;margin-bottom:30px\" src=\"https://d31h13bdjwgzxs.cloudfront.net/academy/optimism-university/Guide/optimism_holders_optimism_university_826/1696859112012_untitled-2023-09-21-1651.png\"/>\n</div>\n\nIf you choose not to assign your voting authority to another delegate, you will still have to delegate your vote to your own address in order to participate in the voting process:\n\n### Register Yourself\nIf you prefer not to delegate your voting power to a representative, you have the option to delegate to yourself. By following the [delegate commitment template](https://gov.optimism.io/t/delegate-commitments/235) on the [Optimism Governance Portal](https://vote.optimism.io/), you can register as a delegate and retain full control over your voting power. \n\n### Use Delegates App\nAfter completing the process, visit the delegates app to confirm that you have successfully delegated your tokens to your own address.\n\n### Start Voting \nOnce you have been added as a delegate in the next voting cycle, you can start voting on governance matters."

          "details": "### Funding Sources in the OP Economy\n\nThe funding for the OP economy comes from the ownership of OP Mainnet and the value of its blockspace. Currently, funding is obtained through the centralized sequencer, which is then redistributed by The Optimism Foundation. However, in the future, funding can be obtained by selling the right to participate in Optimism's decentralized sequencing network. This sustainable revenue source ensures the growth and sustainability of the OP economic model.\n\nMany markets fail to adequately fund and support public goods. Optimism addresses this issue by integrating a sustainable funding source into the network itself. Retroactive Public Goods Funding (RetroPGF) plays a crucial role in distributing sequencer revenue back to the ecosystem. This incentivizes individuals to contribute to the public good of the Optimism Collective. The Citizens' House, through voting, determines the distribution of funds to individuals, teams, projects, or communities that have made a positive impact.\n\nThe Foundation expects RetroPGF to drive a wide range of downstream effects, benefiting the entire Optimism Collective. This mechanism not only funds public goods but also provides exit liquidity for early investment in these projects. By creating conditions for experimentation, the Foundation aims to maximize the long-term value for builders, users, tokenholders, citizens, and the entire Optimism Collective.\n\nThe Optimism Collective operates on the belief that a healthy ecosystem is built on robust public goods. The economics of this ecosystem are designed to generate value for three key groups: tokenholders, contributors and builders, and users and community members:\n\n<div align=\"center\">\n  <img style=\"max-height:400px;margin-bottom:30px\" src=\"https://d31h13bdjwgzxs.cloudfront.net/academy/optimism-university/Guide/optimism_holders_optimism_university_826/1696859318402_untitled-2023-09-21-1651.png\"/>\n</div>\n\n### Tokenholders\nTokenholders benefit from the productive re-deployment of sequencer revenue. This revenue is primarily directed towards funding public goods, which not only creates value for the ecosystem but also drives demand for blockspace. As the network grows, the value of tokenholder investments increases.\n\n### Contributors & Builders\nContributors and builders play a crucial role in the Optimism Collective. They receive direct benefits from retroactive public goods funding and the markets it enables. Additionally, they benefit from a well-funded ecosystem that provides them with the necessary tools, education, apps, and infrastructure to build and thrive.\n\n### Users & Community Members\nUsers and community members also reap the rewards of the OP ecosystem. They receive ongoing airdrops of OP tokens, project incentives made possible by OP ecosystem funding, and the overall benefits that public goods provide. This creates a symbiotic relationship where the community members contribute to the ecosystem's growth and, in turn, benefit from its success."

This fund will directly support the communities and companies that drive the expansion of the Collective ecosystem, known as OPCOs. The allocation dedicated to the Ecosystem Fund will be further divided into different categories. It is important to mention that the Ecosystem Fund is intended to be a kick-starting mechanism that will eventually be phased out once the OP in the fund has been depleted.\n\n### Airdrops\n\nThe Optimism Foundation aims to reward and attract users from both the Optimism and Ethereum communities through the distribution of OP tokens. This distribution will occur in multiple waves, with the first wave being Airdrop #1. Airdrop #1 was designed to cast a wide net and distribute OP to over 250k addresses. To ensure fairness, the eligibility criteria for this airdrop can be found in the Airdrop #1 documentation. Additionally, 14% of the OP token supply will be reserved for future user airdrops.\n\n### RetroPGF\n\nAn allocation of 8.8% of the OP token supply will be held in reserve for future programs, to be determined by the Foundation and/or the governance community. Retroactive Public Goods Funding (RetroPGF) will be distributed by the Citizens' House, with rounds expected to occur quarterly. The objective of RetroPGF is to ensure that all OPCOs are adequately rewarded based on their impact to the Collective. The Optimism Foundation may tap into the 20% RetroPGF Reserve to increase the total OP payout of any given period.\n\n### Core Contributors & Sugar Xaddies\n\nThe Core Contributors allocation will be distributed to the individuals who played a crucial role in bringing Optimism and the Optimism Collective from concept to reality. These tokens will also continue to support the development of the protocol. Both the Core Contributors and Sugar Xaddies allocations will be subject to a lockup period."

      "details": "### Who is a Delegate?\n\nBlockchain technology has revolutionized various industries, offering faster and more cost-effective transactions. The Optimism blockchain, built on the Ethereum network, is one such innovative technology. It utilizes a unique system of delegates to manage the governance of the network. \n\nIn the Optimism blockchain, a delegate is an individual selected to make governance decisions on behalf of token holders. Token holders have the option to delegate their voting power to someone else, who will then represent them in decision-making processes. It is important to note that token holders retain full ownership of their tokens and can change their delegates at any time.\n\n### Role of Delegates\nDelegates in the Optimism blockchain are responsible for managing the governance of the network. They propose, vote, and execute changes to the network, ensuring its smooth operation. To be eligible for election as a delegate, individuals must meet specific criteria, such as holding a minimum number of tokens and having a good reputation within the community.\n\n<div align=\"center\">\n  <img style=\"max-height:400px;margin-bottom:30px\" src=\"https://d31h13bdjwgzxs.cloudfront.net/academy/optimism-university/Guide/delegates_optimism_university_877/1696860470722_untitled-2023-09-21-1651.png\"/>\n</div>\n\nOnce elected, delegates can propose changes to the network, such as protocol upgrades or modifications to the fee structure. These proposals are then put to a vote, allowing token holders to express their support or opposition. The proposal with the highest number of votes is executed, and the delegate is responsible for implementing the approved changes.\n\nDelegates play a crucial role in the governance of the Optimism blockchain. By allowing token holders to delegate their voting power, the network becomes more democratic and less susceptible to control by a small group of individuals. Delegates ensure that the network is managed in a fair and transparent manner, preventing centralization and promoting inclusivity.\n\nAs blockchain technology evolves, it is essential to have a mechanism in place for making necessary changes to the network. Delegates provide this mechanism in the Optimism blockchain. They help ensure that the network remains up-to-date and secure by proposing and implementing upgrades and maintenance activities.",

          "details": "Participating in Token House governance can be a time-consuming task. To alleviate this burden, individuals have the option to delegate their voting power to community members who have volunteered to actively participate in Token House governance. However, being a delegate is not a responsibility to be taken lightly. Before deciding to become a delegate, it is crucial to understand the responsibilities and commitments that come with this role. Let's explore the steps to becoming a delegate and the expectations associated with it:\n\n### Commit\nThe first step towards becoming a delegate is to familiarize yourself with the delegate responsibilities. These responsibilities can be found on the [forum](https://gov.optimism.io/t/delegate-commitments/235) dedicated to Token House governance. It is essential to thoroughly read and comprehend these responsibilities to ensure that you are fully aware of what is expected from you as a delegate. Understanding these responsibilities will help you make an informed decision about whether or not you are ready to take on this role.\n\n<div align=\"center\">\n  <img style=\"max-height:400px;margin-bottom:30px\" src=\"https://d31h13bdjwgzxs.cloudfront.net/academy/optimism-university/Guide/delegates_optimism_university_877/1696860571760_untitled-2023-09-21-1651.png\"/>\n</div>\n\n### Set up Profile\nOnce you have familiarized yourself with the delegate responsibilities, the next step is to register as a delegate on the [Optimism Governance Portal (Optimism Agora)](https://vote.optimism.io/). This portal serves as the platform for Token House governance, and registering as a delegate will allow you to actively participate in the decision-making process. To register, you will need to complete the [delegate commitment form](https://gov.optimism.io/t/delegate-commitments/235) provided on the portal. This form will require you to provide relevant information and agree to fulfill your responsibilities as a delegate.\n\nWhile not mandatory, it is advisable to delegate your own OP tokens' voting power to yourself. By doing so, you retain control over your voting power and can actively participate in the decision-making process. Self-delegating ensures that your voice is heard and that you have a say in the governance of Token House. However, it is important to note that token grants should not be self-delegated to grant recipients. This ensures fairness and prevents any conflicts of interest."

          "details": "Existing delegates play a crucial role in the governance process. By keeping in mind the following guidelines, delegates can effectively contribute to the decision-making process and help shape the future of the community:\n\n### 1. Join Discord Channels\nAs an existing delegate, it is important to actively participate in the governance discussions. Join the relevant channels on [Discord](https://discord-gateway.optimism.io/) to engage in conversations with other delegates and stay updated on important governance events. The [#gov-general channel](https://discord.com/channels/667044843901681675/968498307913637919) is specifically designed for general governance discussions, while the [#token-house-gov channel](https://discord.com/channels/667044843901681675/991340698995544176) provides announcements about significant events in the governance process. Additionally, the [#grants channel](https://discord.com/channels/667044843901681675/1069653708369047623) allows delegates to discuss the grants process and provide feedback to grant applicants. Lastly, the [#delegate-discussion channel](https://discord.com/channels/667044843901681675/989611992295813241) is a platform for larger delegates to collaborate and discuss proposals and the overall governance process.\n\n### 2. Provide Feedback\nTo contribute to the decision-making process, delegates should provide feedback on draft proposals. This can be done in the [Proposals Discussion](https://gov.optimism.io/c/proposals/38) section of the Forum. By sharing your thoughts and insights, you can help shape the direction of the proposals and ensure that they align with the interests of the community. Remember, your feedback can have a significant impact on the final outcome of the proposals.\n\n<div align=\"center\">\n  <img style=\"max-height:400px;margin-bottom:30px\" src=\"https://d31h13bdjwgzxs.cloudfront.net/academy/optimism-university/Guide/delegates_optimism_university_877/1696860762421_untitled-2023-09-21-1651.png\"/>\n</div>\n\n### 3. Approve Non-Grant Proposals\nIf you possess more than 0.5% of the voting supply, you have the authority to approve non-grant proposals. To exercise this power, simply post the following phrase in a forum comment on Discourse: \"I am an Optimism delegate with sufficient voting power and I believe this proposal is ready to move to a vote.\" By approving proposals, you contribute to the decision-making process and help determine which proposals should proceed to the voting stage.\n\n### 4. Vote on Non-Grant Proposals\nAs an existing delegate, it is crucial to exercise your voting power on non-grant proposals. Utilize the [Optimism Governance Portal](https://vote.optimism.io/) to cast your vote and make your voice heard. Remember to carefully consider the proposals and their potential impact on the community before making your decision. Additionally, after voting, it is recommended to provide a voting rationale in a [Delegate Communications Thread](https://gov.optimism.io/c/governance/41). This allows you to explain your decision and engage in further discussions with other delegates.\n\n### 5. Stay Up to Date\nTo effectively fulfill your role as a delegate, it is essential to stay informed about voting cycles and general governance updates. The Governance section of the [Forum](https://gov.optimism.io/c/governance/41) provides valuable information on these matters. Additionally, the [governance calendar](https://calendar.google.com/calendar/u/0/r?cid=Y180aHVpNzBpdG0wODllN3Q4cTUwaGVoMWtub0Bncm91cC5jYWxlbmRhci5nb29nbGUuY29t) highlights when important governance calls take place. By staying up to date, you can actively participate in the decision-making process and contribute to the overall governance of the community."
