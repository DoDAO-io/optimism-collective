          "details": "### What is Optimism Collective?\n\nThe Optimism Collective is a revolutionary concept that aims to reshape the way we organize and govern ourselves in the digital age. In the current cyberspace, we face a significant market failure because the economic rules that govern it were designed for the physical world. However, cyberspace is built on information, which can be freely replicated, making public goods crucial for its growth. Unfortunately, our markets are not equipped to nurture this growth and reward the creators of these public goods for their impact.\n\nThe Optimism Collective seeks to change this by introducing a new model of digital democratic governance. It is a coalition of communities, companies, and citizens who have come together with a shared goal: to reward positive impact with profit. This principle, impact=profit, serves as their guiding light, motivating the creation of a more productive and empathetic economy. The Collective aims to dispel the misconception that public goods cannot be profitable and consistently provides retroactive incentives for public goods that benefit Optimism, Ethereum, and the Collective as a whole. The following diagram showcases the two governing bodies of Optimism Collective: \n\n<div align=\"center\">\n  <img style=\"max-height:400px;margin-bottom:30px\" src=\"https://d31h13bdjwgzxs.cloudfront.net/academy/optimism-university/Guide/optimism_collective_optimism_university_778/1695662417127_untitled-2023-09-25-1547.png\"/>\n</div>\n\n### Mechanism of OP Collective\n\nBy incentivizing the creation of public goods, the Optimism Collective propels the growth of the decentralized ecosystem. As the Collective expands, so does the scope of what falls under the umbrella of public goods. They envision a future where the Collective extends beyond the digital realm and into the physical world, reliably providing for basic human needs at scale. While this may seem idealistic today, they approach it with an overwhelming sense of optimism and a belief that it will become commonplace in the future.\n\nThe Optimism Collective operates on the belief that public goods and profitability can go hand in hand. Often, public goods are underfunded because the incentives are not properly aligned, forcing individuals and organizations to choose between profit and the common good. However, the Collective is bound by a mutually beneficial pact, where impact equals profit. They deploy a new model called retroactive public goods funding, which rewards those who create or sustain public goods. This funding mechanism is advantageous because it is easier to identify what is useful and who built it, rather than predicting future usefulness and the best team to build it.\n\nRetroactive public goods funding also encourages initial investment in public good development by offering the possibility of an eventual exit payment. This mirrors the way investors fund startups today, with the potential for an IPO or buyout. By aligning incentives and providing retroactive funding, the Optimism Collective aims to support projects and communities that are building for the common good and creating a sustainable future for Ethereum.",

          "shortTitle": "Optimism Foundation",
          "details": "The Optimism Foundation plays a crucial role in supporting the establishment of the Optimism Collective and the development of the Optimism ecosystem. It is part of a larger network of companies, groups, and individuals working towards the realization of the Optimistic Vision. As an established entity, the Foundation has the ability to enter into legally enforceable commitments, allowing it to act quickly and safely to support the Collective in its early stages.\n\n### Governance\nOne of the key responsibilities of the Optimism Foundation is its stewardship role in facilitating various administrative aspects of Collective governance. It helps develop frameworks such as the Working Constitution and the Operating Manual, which are essential for facilitating participation within the Collective. By providing these administrative services, the Foundation ensures that the Collective operates smoothly and efficiently.\n\n<div align=\"center\">\n  <img style=\"max-height:400px;margin-bottom:30px\" src=\"https://d31h13bdjwgzxs.cloudfront.net/academy/optimism-university/Guide/optimism_collective_optimism_university_778/1695645715836_untitled-2023-09-25-1547.png\"/>\n</div>\n\n### Support Optimism Protocol\nThe Foundation also plays a vital role in supporting the Optimism protocol as an open-source project. It encourages and enables the community to contribute to the technical architecture of the protocol. Additionally, the Foundation commissions technical research on scalability, security, and decentralization, ensuring that the Optimism protocol remains robust and reliable. By supporting the development of the protocol, the Foundation contributes to the growth and success of the Optimism ecosystem.\n\n### Future Goals\nWhile the Optimism Foundation currently provides administrative services and support, its ultimate aim is to coordinate contributors in creating the technical and governance foundations that will allow for decentralization over time. The Foundation recognizes the importance of empowering the community and gradually reducing its own role. This approach ensures that the Collective becomes self-sustaining and capable of making independent decisions in the future.",

          "details": "The Optimism Foundation operates under a well-defined structure and set of processes to ensure effective governance and accountability. Let's take a closer look at the foundation's work processes and how they contribute to its smooth functioning:\n\n### Governing Body\nThe foundation is governed by a Board of Directors, which currently consists of Abbey Titcomb, Ben Jones, Brian Avello, Eva Beylin, and Jing. The board's primary role is to manage the foundation's business and affairs. They oversee the foundation's directors and ensure that they fulfill their legal obligations. Additionally, a supervisor is appointed to provide guidance and support to the board.\n\n<div align=\"center\">\n  <img style=\"max-height:400px;margin-bottom:30px\" src=\"https://d31h13bdjwgzxs.cloudfront.net/academy/optimism-university/Guide/optimism_collective_optimism_university_778/1695662760150_untitled-2023-09-25-1547.png\"/>\n</div>\n\n### Employment\nTo execute its operational and administrative aims, the foundation employs officers, contractors, and service providers. These individuals and entities play a crucial role in carrying out the day-to-day tasks and responsibilities of the foundation. They work closely with the board and other stakeholders to ensure the smooth functioning of the foundation.\n\n### Legal Accountability\nAs a Cayman Islands foundation company, the Optimism Foundation is legally accountable to its governing documentation. This documentation establishes the foundation's commitment to defer to the will of the Optimism Collective and its governance. The foundation is required to observe and implement the outcome of valid governance votes diligently and in a commercially reasonable manner. However, the foundation's discretion is limited to proposals that are unsafe, insecure, inconsistent with its purpose, legally non-compliant, or would hinder its ability to function effectively.",

          "details": "To ensure accountability and transparency, the foundation has implemented three governance proposal types. These proposals are designed to protect the rights of OP token holders and maintain transparency within the organization. By having these proposals in place, the foundation aims to align its financial resources with the collective's interests and priorities:\n\n### Vote for Disbursement\nThe foundation's financial resources are subject to an annual vote. This means that the amount of OP tokens available for disbursement are determined through a vote by the collective. By involving the collective in this decision-making process, the foundation ensures that its financial resources are allocated in a manner that aligns with the interests and priorities of the token holders.\n\n<div align=\"center\">\n  <img style=\"max-height:400px;margin-bottom:30px\" src=\"https://d31h13bdjwgzxs.cloudfront.net/academy/optimism-university/Guide/optimism_collective_optimism_university_778/1695645916513_untitled-2023-09-25-1547.png\"/>\n</div>\n\n### Director Removal\nThe governance has the authority to remove any member of the foundation's Board of Directors from service. This power is crucial in holding board members accountable for their actions and decisions. It allows for the removal of any director who fails to fulfill their responsibilities or acts against the best interests of the foundation. By having this authority, the governance ensures that the board members are held to a high standard and that their actions are in line with the foundation's goals.\n\n### Power to Veto\nThe Token House, representing the OP token holders, has the power to veto any proposed changes to the foundation's governing documents that would significantly reduce the rights of OP token holders. This mechanism serves as a safeguard for the interests and rights of the token holders. It ensures that their voices are heard and respected, and that any changes to the governing documents are in line with their best interests. By giving the Token House this power, the foundation demonstrates its commitment to protecting the rights of the token holders.",

      "details": "### What is Token House?\n\nToken House is an integral part of the Optimism Collective's governance structure. It was established alongside the launch of the OP token, which was distributed to addresses that demonstrated positive-sum, community-oriented behavior through Airdrop #1. \n\nThe Token House Governance Contract serves as the on-chain voting contract for all governance proposals submitted by Token House members. This is where all qualifying proposals are submitted for voting. To facilitate the voting process, the Optimism Governance Portal provides a user-friendly interface for Token House members to delegate their voting power and cast their votes on-chain.\n\n### How to become a Token House Member?\n\nThere are several avenues available for obtaining OP tokens and becoming a part of the Optimism ecosystem. One common method is through airdrops, which involve the distribution of tokens to eligible users based on specific criteria. Airdrops are frequently employed to recognize early adopters, active participants, or contributors to the project.\n\nAnother way to acquire OP tokens is through cryptocurrency trading platforms. For instance, Crypto.com offers a user-friendly platform for purchasing and trading OP tokens. By setting up an account and completing the required verification process, users gain access to the OP token market and can commence trading.\n\nFurthermore, engagement within the Optimism ecosystem presents opportunities for earning OP tokens. Individuals who contribute to the development, testing, or promotion of Optimism's technology may qualify for token rewards or incentives. Staying connected with the Optimism community and keeping abreast of the network's official communication channels enables contributors to stay informed about potential avenues for earning tokens.\n\nThe Optimism Forum plays a crucial role in the governance process by providing a platform for discussion and deliberation on governance proposals. It serves as a space where Token House members can engage in meaningful conversations and share their perspectives. In the future, additional user interfaces dedicated to governance councils may be developed to further enhance the governance experience.\n\n### Role of OP Token Holders\n\n**Participation in Decentralized Governance:** OP token holders have the opportunity to participate in the decentralized governance of the Optimism ecosystem.\n\n**Proposal Rights:** They can propose changes, updates, and enhancements to the protocol.\n\n**Voting Privileges:** OP token holders can cast votes on important matters such as protocol upgrades and fee structures.\n\n**Shaping the Network's Future:** Through their proposals and votes, they play a pivotal role in shaping the future development and direction of the Optimism network.\n\n### Proposals\n\n<div align=\"center\">\n  <img style=\"max-height:400px;margin-bottom:30px\" src=\"https://d31h13bdjwgzxs.cloudfront.net/academy/optimism-university/Guide/token_house_optimism_university_389/1695651189435_untitled-2023-09-25-1547.png\"/>\n</div>\n\nGrant proposals, known as Season 3 grant applications, are reviewed by the Grants Council and follow a separate submission process outlined in the [Grants Council: Internal Operating Procedures](https://gov.optimism.io/t/grants-council-internal-operating-procedures/4832). Non-grant proposals, on the other hand, should be posted on the [Forum](http://gov.optimism.io/) for review by the entire Optimism community. These proposals must be formatted according to the [standard proposal template](https://gov.optimism.io/t/standard-proposal-template-optimism-token-house/5443) and contain relevant information.\n\n### Voting on Proposals\n\nCurrently, voting takes place on-chain through the Governance Contract. However, the implementation of successful votes is administered by the Optimism Foundation, which may change in the future. To proceed to the voting stage, a proposal must be one of the valid proposal types and follow the specified voting process. \n\nTo move a non-grant proposal to the voting stage, it must receive explicit approval from four delegates, each holding more than 0.25% of the current votable token supply. Delegates can signal their approval by posting a specific comment on the proposal discussion thread. However, their approval does not imply an endorsement of the proposal, but rather indicates that they believe the proposal is ready for voting. Once a proposal receives four delegate approvals, the proposal author should update the title and provide a link to their proposal in the Voting Cycle Roundup thread by the last day of Week 3.\n\n### Future Submissions\n\nIf a proposal author does not receive explicit delegate approval or wishes to gather more feedback, they can continue seeking input from the community and submit an updated proposal in the next voting cycle. This ensures that proposals have ample opportunity for improvement and refinement before moving forward in the governance process.",
