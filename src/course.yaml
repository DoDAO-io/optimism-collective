    title: Navigating Optimism Collective
    details: >-
      In this course, we will delve into the fascinating world of Optimism
      Collective, a leading decentralized platform. Our focus will be on
      providing you with a comprehensive understanding of its governance
      structure, the influential Optimism Foundation, the role of OP holders,
      and the significance of delegates. Additionally, we will explore the
      critical aspects of grants within the Optimism ecosystem.


      Our journey begins with an introduction to Optimism, where we will uncover
      its essential role in the blockchain landscape. Next, we will explore the
      governance framework, shedding light on how decisions are made within
      Optimism. The Optimism Foundation plays a pivotal role in this ecosystem,
      and we will closely examine its mission and influence.


      Grants are essential for driving innovation within Optimism, and we will
      guide you through the process of securing grants. You'll also have the
      opportunity to explore success stories of projects funded through Optimism
      grants.


      Lastly, this course continues by delving into the world of OP holders and
      delegates, elucidating their roles and significance in Optimism's
      governance structure. We will explore how these stakeholders shape the
      ecosystem's direction.


      This course is designed to empower you with the knowledge and insights
      needed to engage with and contribute to the growth of Optimism.

    title: Token House
    details: >-
      ### What is Token House?


      Token House is an integral part of the Optimism Collective's governance
      structure. It was established alongside the launch of the OP token, which
      was distributed to addresses that demonstrated positive-sum,
      community-oriented behavior through Airdrop #1. 


      The Token House Governance Contract serves as the on-chain voting contract
      for all governance proposals submitted by Token House members. This is
      where all qualifying proposals are submitted for voting. To facilitate the
      voting process, the Optimism Governance Portal provides a user-friendly
      interface for Token House members to delegate their voting power and cast
      their votes on-chain.


      ### How to become a Token House Member?


      There are several avenues available for obtaining OP tokens and becoming a
      part of the Optimism ecosystem. One common method is through airdrops,
      which involve the distribution of tokens to eligible users based on
      specific criteria. Airdrops are frequently employed to recognize early
      adopters, active participants, or contributors to the project.


      Another way to acquire OP tokens is through cryptocurrency trading
      platforms. For instance, Crypto.com offers a user-friendly platform for
      purchasing and trading OP tokens. By setting up an account and completing
      the required verification process, users gain access to the OP token
      market and can commence trading.


      Furthermore, engagement within the Optimism ecosystem presents
      opportunities for earning OP tokens. Individuals who contribute to the
      development, testing, or promotion of Optimism's technology may qualify
      for token rewards or incentives. Staying connected with the Optimism
      community and keeping abreast of the network's official communication
      channels enables contributors to stay informed about potential avenues for
      earning tokens.


      The Optimism Forum plays a crucial role in the governance process by
      providing a platform for discussion and deliberation on governance
      proposals. It serves as a space where Token House members can engage in
      meaningful conversations and share their perspectives. In the future,
      additional user interfaces dedicated to governance councils may be
      developed to further enhance the governance experience.


      ### Role of OP Token Holders


      **Participation in Decentralized Governance:** OP token holders have the
      opportunity to participate in the decentralized governance of the Optimism
      ecosystem.


      **Proposal Rights:** They can propose changes, updates, and enhancements
      to the protocol.


      **Voting Privileges:** OP token holders can cast votes on important
      matters such as protocol upgrades and fee structures.


      **Shaping the Network's Future:** Through their proposals and votes, they
      play a pivotal role in shaping the future development and direction of the
      Optimism network.


      ### Proposals

      </div>


      Grant proposals, known as Season 3 grant applications, are reviewed by the
      Grants Council and follow a separate submission process outlined in the
      [Grants Council: Internal Operating
      Procedures](https://gov.optimism.io/t/grants-council-internal-operating-procedures/4832).
      Non-grant proposals, on the other hand, should be posted on the
      [Forum](http://gov.optimism.io/) for review by the entire Optimism
      community. These proposals must be formatted according to the [standard
      proposal
      template](https://gov.optimism.io/t/standard-proposal-template-optimism-token-house/5443)
      and contain relevant information.


      ### Voting on Proposals


      Currently, voting takes place on-chain through the Governance Contract.
      However, the implementation of successful votes is administered by the
      Optimism Foundation, which may change in the future. To proceed to the
      voting stage, a proposal must be one of the valid proposal types and
      follow the specified voting process. 


      To move a non-grant proposal to the voting stage, it must receive explicit
      approval from four delegates, each holding more than 0.25% of the current
      votable token supply. Delegates can signal their approval by posting a
      specific comment on the proposal discussion thread. However, their
      approval does not imply an endorsement of the proposal, but rather
      indicates that they believe the proposal is ready for voting. Once a
      proposal receives four delegate approvals, the proposal author should
      update the title and provide a link to their proposal in the Voting Cycle
      Roundup thread by the last day of Week 3.


      ### Future Submissions


      If a proposal author does not receive explicit delegate approval or wishes
      to gather more feedback, they can continue seeking input from the
      community and submit an updated proposal in the next voting cycle. This
      ensures that proposals have ample opportunity for improvement and
      refinement before moving forward in the governance process.
