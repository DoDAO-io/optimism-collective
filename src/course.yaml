    title: Navigating Optimism Collective
    details: >-
      ### What is Optimism Collective?


      The Optimism Collective is a revolutionary concept that aims to reshape
      the way we organize and govern ourselves in the digital age. In the
      current cyberspace, we face a significant market failure because the
      economic rules that govern it were designed for the physical world.
      However, cyberspace is built on information, which can be freely
      replicated, making public goods crucial for its growth. Unfortunately, our
      markets are not equipped to nurture this growth and reward the creators of
      these public goods for their impact.


      The Optimism Collective seeks to change this by introducing a new model of
      digital democratic governance. It is a coalition of communities,
      companies, and citizens who have come together with a shared goal: to
      reward positive impact with profit. This principle, impact=profit, serves
      as their guiding light, motivating the creation of a more productive and
      empathetic economy. The Collective aims to dispel the misconception that
      public goods cannot be profitable and consistently provides retroactive
      incentives for public goods that benefit Optimism, Ethereum, and the
      Collective as a whole. The following diagram showcases the two governing
      bodies of Optimism Collective:

      </div>


      ### Mechanism of OP Collective


      By incentivizing the creation of public goods, the Optimism Collective
      propels the growth of the decentralized ecosystem. As the Collective
      expands, so does the scope of what falls under the umbrella of public
      goods. They envision a future where the Collective extends beyond the
      digital realm and into the physical world, reliably providing for basic
      human needs at scale. While this may seem idealistic today, they approach
      it with an overwhelming sense of optimism and a belief that it will become
      commonplace in the future.


      The Optimism Collective operates on the belief that public goods and
      profitability can go hand in hand. Often, public goods are underfunded
      because the incentives are not properly aligned, forcing individuals and
      organizations to choose between profit and the common good. However, the
      Collective is bound by a mutually beneficial pact, where impact equals
      profit. They deploy a new model called retroactive public goods funding,
      which rewards those who create or sustain public goods. This funding
      mechanism is advantageous because it is easier to identify what is useful
      and who built it, rather than predicting future usefulness and the best
      team to build it.


      Retroactive public goods funding also encourages initial investment in
      public good development by offering the possibility of an eventual exit
      payment. This mirrors the way investors fund startups today, with the
      potential for an IPO or buyout. By aligning incentives and providing
      retroactive funding, the Optimism Collective aims to support projects and
      communities that are building for the common good and creating a
      sustainable future for Ethereum.

    title: Token House
    details: >-
      ### What is Token House?


      Token House is an integral part of the Optimism Collective's governance
      structure. It was established alongside the launch of the OP token, which
      was distributed to addresses that demonstrated positive-sum,
      community-oriented behavior through Airdrop #1. 


      The Token House Governance Contract serves as the on-chain voting contract
      for all governance proposals submitted by Token House members. This is
      where all qualifying proposals are submitted for voting. To facilitate the
      voting process, the Optimism Governance Portal provides a user-friendly
      interface for Token House members to delegate their voting power and cast
      their votes on-chain.


      ### How to become a Token House Member?


      There are several avenues available for obtaining OP tokens and becoming a
      part of the Optimism ecosystem. One common method is through airdrops,
      which involve the distribution of tokens to eligible users based on
      specific criteria. Airdrops are frequently employed to recognize early
      adopters, active participants, or contributors to the project.


      Another way to acquire OP tokens is through cryptocurrency trading
      platforms. For instance, Crypto.com offers a user-friendly platform for
      purchasing and trading OP tokens. By setting up an account and completing
      the required verification process, users gain access to the OP token
      market and can commence trading.


      Furthermore, engagement within the Optimism ecosystem presents
      opportunities for earning OP tokens. Individuals who contribute to the
      development, testing, or promotion of Optimism's technology may qualify
      for token rewards or incentives. Staying connected with the Optimism
      community and keeping abreast of the network's official communication
      channels enables contributors to stay informed about potential avenues for
      earning tokens.


      The Optimism Forum plays a crucial role in the governance process by
      providing a platform for discussion and deliberation on governance
      proposals. It serves as a space where Token House members can engage in
      meaningful conversations and share their perspectives. In the future,
      additional user interfaces dedicated to governance councils may be
      developed to further enhance the governance experience.


      ### Role of OP Token Holders


      **Participation in Decentralized Governance:** OP token holders have the
      opportunity to participate in the decentralized governance of the Optimism
      ecosystem.


      **Proposal Rights:** They can propose changes, updates, and enhancements
      to the protocol.


      **Voting Privileges:** OP token holders can cast votes on important
      matters such as protocol upgrades and fee structures.


      **Shaping the Network's Future:** Through their proposals and votes, they
      play a pivotal role in shaping the future development and direction of the
      Optimism network.


      ### Proposals


      <div align="center">
        <img style="max-height:400px;margin-bottom:30px" src="https://d31h13bdjwgzxs.cloudfront.net/academy/optimism-university/Guide/token_house_optimism_university_389/1695651189435_untitled-2023-09-25-1547.png"/>
      </div>


      Grant proposals, known as Season 3 grant applications, are reviewed by the
      Grants Council and follow a separate submission process outlined in the
      [Grants Council: Internal Operating
      Procedures](https://gov.optimism.io/t/grants-council-internal-operating-procedures/4832).
      Non-grant proposals, on the other hand, should be posted on the
      [Forum](http://gov.optimism.io/) for review by the entire Optimism
      community. These proposals must be formatted according to the [standard
      proposal
      template](https://gov.optimism.io/t/standard-proposal-template-optimism-token-house/5443)
      and contain relevant information.


      ### Voting on Proposals


      Currently, voting takes place on-chain through the Governance Contract.
      However, the implementation of successful votes is administered by the
      Optimism Foundation, which may change in the future. To proceed to the
      voting stage, a proposal must be one of the valid proposal types and
      follow the specified voting process. 


      To move a non-grant proposal to the voting stage, it must receive explicit
      approval from four delegates, each holding more than 0.25% of the current
      votable token supply. Delegates can signal their approval by posting a
      specific comment on the proposal discussion thread. However, their
      approval does not imply an endorsement of the proposal, but rather
      indicates that they believe the proposal is ready for voting. Once a
      proposal receives four delegate approvals, the proposal author should
      update the title and provide a link to their proposal in the Voting Cycle
      Roundup thread by the last day of Week 3.


      ### Future Submissions


      If a proposal author does not receive explicit delegate approval or wishes
      to gather more feedback, they can continue seeking input from the
      community and submit an updated proposal in the next voting cycle. This
      ensures that proposals have ample opportunity for improvement and
      refinement before moving forward in the governance process.

    title: Citizens' House
    details: >-
      ### What is Citizen House?


      The Citizens' House is an innovative approach to governance that aims to
      promote fairness and inclusivity. It is a part of the Optimism Collective,
      working alongside the Token House to govern the collective. In its initial
      stage, the Citizens' House is responsible for voting on the allocation of
      Retroactive Public Goods Funding (RetroPGF). This funding is used to
      support public goods that have already been provided.


      During this early phase, the Optimism Foundation takes charge of
      determining the scope and amount of each funding round. They also oversee
      the voting process. It's important to note that holding a voting badge
      during this stage does not guarantee permanent participation in the
      Citizens' House or future rounds of RetroPGF.

      </div>


      ### Role & Responsibilities


      **Collaboration with Token House:** The Citizens' House collaborates with
      the Token House to make decisions regarding the allocation of surplus
      protocol revenue. This collaboration ensures a balanced governance system.


      **Defining Participation Criteria:** The Citizens' House plays a role in
      defining the criteria for participation in the governance process,
      ensuring that those involved meet certain requirements or standards.


      **Enforcement of Codes of Conduct:** It ensures adherence to the
      Collective's Codes of Conduct, helping maintain a respectful and ethical
      environment within the governance system.


      **RetroPGF Rounds:** The Citizens' House is closely associated with
      RetroPGF rounds, which follow a predefined process involving phases such
      as scoping, nominations, profile creation, voting, and disbursements.


      **KYC Procedures:** The Foundation performs Know Your Customer (KYC)
      procedures as part of the grant distribution process, ensuring
      transparency and compliance with regulatory requirements.

    title: Optimism Foundation
    details: >-
      The Optimism Foundation plays a crucial role in supporting the
      establishment of the Optimism Collective and the development of the
      Optimism ecosystem. It is part of a larger network of companies, groups,
      and individuals working towards the realization of the Optimistic Vision.
      As an established entity, the Foundation has the ability to enter into
      legally enforceable commitments, allowing it to act quickly and safely to
      support the Collective in its early stages.


      ### Governance

      One of the key responsibilities of the Optimism Foundation is its
      stewardship role in facilitating various administrative aspects of
      Collective governance. It helps develop frameworks such as the Working
      Constitution and the Operating Manual, which are essential for
      facilitating participation within the Collective. By providing these
      administrative services, the Foundation ensures that the Collective
      operates smoothly and efficiently.

      </div>


      ### Support Optimism Protocol

      The Foundation also plays a vital role in supporting the Optimism protocol
      as an open-source project. It encourages and enables the community to
      contribute to the technical architecture of the protocol. Additionally,
      the Foundation commissions technical research on scalability, security,
      and decentralization, ensuring that the Optimism protocol remains robust
      and reliable. By supporting the development of the protocol, the
      Foundation contributes to the growth and success of the Optimism
      ecosystem.


      ### Future Goals

      While the Optimism Foundation currently provides administrative services
      and support, its ultimate aim is to coordinate contributors in creating
      the technical and governance foundations that will allow for
      decentralization over time. The Foundation recognizes the importance of
      empowering the community and gradually reducing its own role. This
      approach ensures that the Collective becomes self-sustaining and capable
      of making independent decisions in the future.

    title: Delegates
    details: >-
      ### Who is a Delegate?


      Blockchain technology has revolutionized various industries, offering
      faster and more cost-effective transactions. The Optimism blockchain,
      built on the Ethereum network, is one such innovative technology. It
      utilizes a unique system of delegates to manage the governance of the
      network. 


      In the Optimism blockchain, a delegate is an individual selected to make
      governance decisions on behalf of token holders. Token holders have the
      option to delegate their voting power to someone else, who will then
      represent them in decision-making processes. It is important to note that
      token holders retain full ownership of their tokens and can change their
      delegates at any time.


      ### Role of Delegates

      Delegates in the Optimism blockchain are responsible for managing the
      governance of the network. They propose, vote, and execute changes to the
      network, ensuring its smooth operation. To be eligible for election as a
      delegate, individuals must meet specific criteria, such as holding a
      minimum number of tokens and having a good reputation within the
      community.


      <div align="center">
        <img style="max-height:400px;margin-bottom:30px" src="https://d31h13bdjwgzxs.cloudfront.net/academy/optimism-university/Guide/delegates_optimism_university_877/1695749412408_untitled-2023-09-26-2024.png"/>
      </div>


      Once elected, delegates can propose changes to the network, such as
      protocol upgrades or modifications to the fee structure. These proposals
      are then put to a vote, allowing token holders to express their support or
      opposition. The proposal with the highest number of votes is executed, and
      the delegate is responsible for implementing the approved changes.


      Delegates play a crucial role in the governance of the Optimism
      blockchain. By allowing token holders to delegate their voting power, the
      network becomes more democratic and less susceptible to control by a small
      group of individuals. Delegates ensure that the network is managed in a
      fair and transparent manner, preventing centralization and promoting
      inclusivity.


      As blockchain technology evolves, it is essential to have a mechanism in
      place for making necessary changes to the network. Delegates provide this
      mechanism in the Optimism blockchain. They help ensure that the network
      remains up-to-date and secure by proposing and implementing upgrades and
      maintenance activities.
