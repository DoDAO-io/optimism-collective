    title: Token House
    details: >-
      ### What is Token House?


      Token House is an integral part of the Optimism Collective's governance
      structure. It was established alongside the launch of the OP token, which
      was distributed to addresses that demonstrated positive-sum,
      community-oriented behavior through Airdrop #1. 


      The Token House Governance Contract serves as the on-chain voting contract
      for all governance proposals submitted by Token House members. This is
      where all qualifying proposals are submitted for voting. To facilitate the
      voting process, the Optimism Governance Portal provides a user-friendly
      interface for Token House members to delegate their voting power and cast
      their votes on-chain.


      ### How to become a Token House Member?


      There are several avenues available for obtaining OP tokens and becoming a
      part of the Optimism ecosystem. One common method is through airdrops,
      which involve the distribution of tokens to eligible users based on
      specific criteria. Airdrops are frequently employed to recognize early
      adopters, active participants, or contributors to the project.


      Another way to acquire OP tokens is through cryptocurrency trading
      platforms. For instance, Crypto.com offers a user-friendly platform for
      purchasing and trading OP tokens. By setting up an account and completing
      the required verification process, users gain access to the OP token
      market and can commence trading.


      Furthermore, engagement within the Optimism ecosystem presents
      opportunities for earning OP tokens. Individuals who contribute to the
      development, testing, or promotion of Optimism's technology may qualify
      for token rewards or incentives. Staying connected with the Optimism
      community and keeping abreast of the network's official communication
      channels enables contributors to stay informed about potential avenues for
      earning tokens.


      The Optimism Forum plays a crucial role in the governance process by
      providing a platform for discussion and deliberation on governance
      proposals. It serves as a space where Token House members can engage in
      meaningful conversations and share their perspectives. In the future,
      additional user interfaces dedicated to governance councils may be
      developed to further enhance the governance experience.


      ### Role of OP Token Holders


      **Participation in Decentralized Governance:** OP token holders have the
      opportunity to participate in the decentralized governance of the Optimism
      ecosystem.


      **Proposal Rights:** They can propose changes, updates, and enhancements
      to the protocol.


      **Voting Privileges:** OP token holders can cast votes on important
      matters such as protocol upgrades and fee structures.


      **Shaping the Network's Future:** Through their proposals and votes, they
      play a pivotal role in shaping the future development and direction of the
      Optimism network.


      ### Proposals

      </div>


      Grant proposals, known as Season 3 grant applications, are reviewed by the
      Grants Council and follow a separate submission process outlined in the
      [Grants Council: Internal Operating
      Procedures](https://gov.optimism.io/t/grants-council-internal-operating-procedures/4832).
      Non-grant proposals, on the other hand, should be posted on the
      [Forum](http://gov.optimism.io/) for review by the entire Optimism
      community. These proposals must be formatted according to the [standard
      proposal
      template](https://gov.optimism.io/t/standard-proposal-template-optimism-token-house/5443)
      and contain relevant information.


      ### Voting on Proposals


      Currently, voting takes place on-chain through the Governance Contract.
      However, the implementation of successful votes is administered by the
      Optimism Foundation, which may change in the future. To proceed to the
      voting stage, a proposal must be one of the valid proposal types and
      follow the specified voting process. 


      To move a non-grant proposal to the voting stage, it must receive explicit
      approval from four delegates, each holding more than 0.25% of the current
      votable token supply. Delegates can signal their approval by posting a
      specific comment on the proposal discussion thread. However, their
      approval does not imply an endorsement of the proposal, but rather
      indicates that they believe the proposal is ready for voting. Once a
      proposal receives four delegate approvals, the proposal author should
      update the title and provide a link to their proposal in the Voting Cycle
      Roundup thread by the last day of Week 3.


      ### Future Submissions


      If a proposal author does not receive explicit delegate approval or wishes
      to gather more feedback, they can continue seeking input from the
      community and submit an updated proposal in the next voting cycle. This
      ensures that proposals have ample opportunity for improvement and
      refinement before moving forward in the governance process.

    title: Citizens' House
    details: >-
      ### What is Citizen House?


      The Citizens' House is an innovative approach to governance that aims to
      promote fairness and inclusivity. It is a part of the Optimism Collective,
      working alongside the Token House to govern the collective. In its initial
      stage, the Citizens' House is responsible for voting on the allocation of
      Retroactive Public Goods Funding (RetroPGF). This funding is used to
      support public goods that have already been provided.


      During this early phase, the Optimism Foundation takes charge of
      determining the scope and amount of each funding round. They also oversee
      the voting process. It's important to note that holding a voting badge
      during this stage does not guarantee permanent participation in the
      Citizens' House or future rounds of RetroPGF.

      </div>


      ### Role & Responsibilities


      **Collaboration with Token House:** The Citizens' House collaborates with
      the Token House to make decisions regarding the allocation of surplus
      protocol revenue. This collaboration ensures a balanced governance system.


      **Defining Participation Criteria:** The Citizens' House plays a role in
      defining the criteria for participation in the governance process,
      ensuring that those involved meet certain requirements or standards.


      **Enforcement of Codes of Conduct:** It ensures adherence to the
      Collective's Codes of Conduct, helping maintain a respectful and ethical
      environment within the governance system.


      **RetroPGF Rounds:** The Citizens' House is closely associated with
      RetroPGF rounds, which follow a predefined process involving phases such
      as scoping, nominations, profile creation, voting, and disbursements.


      **KYC Procedures:** The Foundation performs Know Your Customer (KYC)
      procedures as part of the grant distribution process, ensuring
      transparency and compliance with regulatory requirements.

    title: Optimism Foundation
    details: >-
      The Optimism Foundation plays a crucial role in supporting the
      establishment of the Optimism Collective and the development of the
      Optimism ecosystem. It is part of a larger network of companies, groups,
      and individuals working towards the realization of the Optimistic Vision.
      As an established entity, the Foundation has the ability to enter into
      legally enforceable commitments, allowing it to act quickly and safely to
      support the Collective in its early stages.


      ### Governance

      One of the key responsibilities of the Optimism Foundation is its
      stewardship role in facilitating various administrative aspects of
      Collective governance. It helps develop frameworks such as the Working
      Constitution and the Operating Manual, which are essential for
      facilitating participation within the Collective. By providing these
      administrative services, the Foundation ensures that the Collective
      operates smoothly and efficiently.

      </div>


      ### Support Optimism Protocol

      The Foundation also plays a vital role in supporting the Optimism protocol
      as an open-source project. It encourages and enables the community to
      contribute to the technical architecture of the protocol. Additionally,
      the Foundation commissions technical research on scalability, security,
      and decentralization, ensuring that the Optimism protocol remains robust
      and reliable. By supporting the development of the protocol, the
      Foundation contributes to the growth and success of the Optimism
      ecosystem.


      ### Future Goals

      While the Optimism Foundation currently provides administrative services
      and support, its ultimate aim is to coordinate contributors in creating
      the technical and governance foundations that will allow for
      decentralization over time. The Foundation recognizes the importance of
      empowering the community and gradually reducing its own role. This
      approach ensures that the Collective becomes self-sustaining and capable
      of making independent decisions in the future.
