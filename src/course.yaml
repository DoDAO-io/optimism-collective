      ### What is Optimism Collective?


      The Optimism Collective is a revolutionary concept that aims to reshape
      the way we organize and govern ourselves in the digital age. In the
      current cyberspace, we face a significant market failure because the
      economic rules that govern it were designed for the physical world.
      However, cyberspace is built on information, which can be freely
      replicated, making public goods crucial for its growth. Unfortunately, our
      markets are not equipped to nurture this growth and reward the creators of
      these public goods for their impact.


      The Optimism Collective seeks to change this by introducing a new model of
      digital democratic governance. It is a coalition of communities,
      companies, and citizens who have come together with a shared goal: to
      reward positive impact with profit. This principle, impact=profit, serves
      as their guiding light, motivating the creation of a more productive and
      empathetic economy. The Collective aims to dispel the misconception that
      public goods cannot be profitable and consistently provides retroactive
      incentives for public goods that benefit Optimism, Ethereum, and the
      Collective as a whole. The following diagram showcases the two governing
      bodies of Optimism Collective:

      ### Mechanism of OP Collective


      By incentivizing the creation of public goods, the Optimism Collective
      propels the growth of the decentralized ecosystem. As the Collective
      expands, so does the scope of what falls under the umbrella of public
      goods. They envision a future where the Collective extends beyond the
      digital realm and into the physical world, reliably providing for basic
      human needs at scale. While this may seem idealistic today, they approach
      it with an overwhelming sense of optimism and a belief that it will become
      commonplace in the future.


      The Optimism Collective operates on the belief that public goods and
      profitability can go hand in hand. Often, public goods are underfunded
      because the incentives are not properly aligned, forcing individuals and
      organizations to choose between profit and the common good. However, the
      Collective is bound by a mutually beneficial pact, where impact equals
      profit. They deploy a new model called retroactive public goods funding,
      which rewards those who create or sustain public goods. This funding
      mechanism is advantageous because it is easier to identify what is useful
      and who built it, rather than predicting future usefulness and the best
      team to build it.


      Retroactive public goods funding also encourages initial investment in
      public good development by offering the possibility of an eventual exit
      payment. This mirrors the way investors fund startups today, with the
      potential for an IPO or buyout. By aligning incentives and providing
      retroactive funding, the Optimism Collective aims to support projects and
      communities that are building for the common good and creating a
      sustainable future for Ethereum.
