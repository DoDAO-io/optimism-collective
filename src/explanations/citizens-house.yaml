    ### How to Become a Citizen?


    Becoming a citizen is an important process that involves being recognized as
    a member of a particular community or country. In the context of the
    Citizens' House, citizenship is based on identity and aligning with the
    values of the Collective. This is different from the more common practice of
    token-voting governance. 


    To start the process of becoming a citizen in the Citizens' House,
    participants are given temporary badges that allow them to vote in RetroPGF
    rounds. These rounds serve as a way for individuals to have a say in the
    decision-making process of the Collective. However, holding a voting badge
    does not guarantee permanent citizenship, as membership is determined by
    governance and may change over time. 


    The Citizens' House works in collaboration with the Token House to establish
    criteria for participation in the Citizens' House. This means that the
    requirements for citizenship may evolve and be determined by the collective
    governance of the community. The AttestationStation contract plays a crucial
    role in this process, as it is a neutral and permissionless contract that is
    used to determine the set of citizens based on reputation data.


    ### Number of Citizens


    The number of citizens responsible for voting keeps on increasing in every
    RetroPGF round as depicted in the diagram below:

    ### Citizenship - Now & Future


    The current phase of Citizens' House governance is seeing an increase in the
    number of voting badges with each round of RetroPGF. This shows that the
    community is growing and more individuals are being given the opportunity to
    participate in the decision-making process. However, it is important to note
    that voting in a specific round does not guarantee permanent participation
    in the Citizens' House or future iterations of RetroPGF.


    In the future, the goal is to have a widely distributed citizenship across
    the Optimism ecosystem. This means that individuals from various subcultures
    and industries will have the opportunity to become citizens and contribute
    their expertise to the community. However, it is also important to recognize
    that the criteria for citizenship may change as the governance of the
    community evolves.
