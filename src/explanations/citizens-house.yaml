    The Citizens' House works in collaboration with the Token House to establish
    criteria for participation in the Citizens' House. This means that the
    requirements for citizenship may evolve and be determined by the collective
    governance of the community. The AttestationStation contract plays a crucial
    role in this process, as it is a neutral and permissionless contract that is
    used to determine the set of citizens based on reputation data.


    ### Number of Citizens


    The number of citizens responsible for voting keeps on increasing in every
    RetroPGF round as depicted in the diagram below:

    ### Citizenship - Now & Future


    The current phase of Citizens' House governance is seeing an increase in the
    number of voting badges with each round of RetroPGF. This shows that the
    community is growing and more individuals are being given the opportunity to
    participate in the decision-making process. However, it is important to note
    that voting in a specific round does not guarantee permanent participation
    in the Citizens' House or future iterations of RetroPGF.


    In the future, the goal is to have a widely distributed citizenship across
    the Optimism ecosystem. This means that individuals from various subcultures
    and industries will have the opportunity to become citizens and contribute
    their expertise to the community. However, it is also important to recognize
    that the criteria for citizenship may change as the governance of the
    community evolves.

    ### Retroactive Public Goods Funding


    RetroPGF, is an initiative that aims to provide financial support for public
    goods that are developed and utilized within the Optimism Stack (OP Stack).
    The idea behind RetroPGF is to reward builders who make a positive impact on
    the community by allowing them to profit from their contributions. It
    questions the purpose of building free software for the public good if there
    is no merit or benefit for the builder themselves. 


    The funding provided through RetroPGF is given to projects, companies,
    communities, or other entities that have already proven their value to the
    Optimism ecosystem. This approach is taken because it is easier to identify
    projects that have been useful in the past, rather than predicting their
    future usefulness. By rewarding projects that have already demonstrated
    their usefulness, RetroPGF ensures better capital allocation and encourages
    the development of public goods that have a tangible impact.

    ### RetroPGF Round 1


    The Optimism Collective conducted its first round of Retroactive Public
    Goods Funding (RetroPGF) in the fourth quarter of 2021. This round aimed to
    allocate $1 million to fund projects that have provided value to the
    Optimistic Ethereum ecosystem. A total of 76 projects were nominated, and 58
    of them received funding from the badgeholders. The median funding received
    by a project in RetroPGF 1 was $14,670, while the top 10% of projects
    received more than $36,919.


    The process for RetroPGF Round 1 involved two main stages: badgeholder
    selection and voting. In this round, 24 badgeholders, consisting of 8
    Optimists and 16 Ethereum community members, were chosen to vote on
    distributing retrofunding to the nominated projects. Anyone could nominate a
    project during the nomination period by providing the project name, project
    lead name, project lead email, and impact description. The badgeholders were
    then provided with a manual and asked to evaluate and vote on the nominated
    projects.


    ### RetroPGF Round 2


    The Optimism Collective's second round of Retroactive Public Goods Funding
    took place in the first quarter of 2023. This time, RetroPGF 2 allocated 10
    million OP tokens to fund public goods that support the development and
    usage of the OP Stack. The goal of RetroPGF is to build a global system
    where positive impact to the collective is rewarded by profit to the
    individual. In this round, all 195 nominated people and projects were
    awarded funding by the badgeholders.


    The badgeholders played a crucial role in distributing the OP tokens to the
    projects. For RetroPGF Round 2, badgeholders were selected based on their
    participation in the previous round, through nomination by Optimism's Token
    House, and by nomination from other badgeholders. The nomination period
    allowed anyone to nominate a project by providing its name, impact
    description, and a link to Github/Twitter. Projects then had to create a
    profile with general information and a description of their project and its
    impact.


    ### RetroPGF Round 3


    The third round of Retroactive Public Goods Funding, RetroPGF 3 has
    commenced in the fall of 2023. This round will allocate 30 million OP tokens
    to reward contributions that have supported the development and adoption of
    Optimism. RetroPGF is open to all types of contributors to the Optimism
    ecosystem, including developers, educators, artists, creators, writers,
    builders, and evangelists.


    To be eligible for RetroPGF, your work should have made an impact in one of
    the four categories: OP Stack, Collective Governance, Developer Ecosystem,
    and End User Experience & Adoption. Whether you have enhanced the efficiency
    and security of the OP Stack, provided impact to governance participants or
    application developers, or contributed to the end user experience and
    adoption, you can submit an application for RetroPGF. Voting badges for
    Round 3 have been distributed to 208 community members. 


    RetroPGF aims to fund projects that contribute to the growth and success of
    the Optimism ecosystem, creating a rich ecosystem and a better economy for
    all.
