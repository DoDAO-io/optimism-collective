    ### Importance of Delegation


    Participating in the governance of the Optimism Token House can be a
    time-consuming task. To address this, individuals have the option to
    delegate their voting power to a community member who has volunteered to
    actively participate in Token House governance. However, if you prefer not
    to delegate your voting power, you will still need to delegate to yourself
    in order to vote. Let's explore the process of delegating tokens:


    When trying to delegate your votes to a representative, follow this process:


    ### Choosing Your Delegate

    Delegating your voting power is a crucial decision, so it is essential to
    take the time to read through delegate statements of interest. These
    statements provide insights into the delegate's stance on various governance
    matters. By carefully considering these statements, you can select a
    delegate who aligns with your values and priorities. Remember, a healthy
    governance system benefits both Optimism and all OP token holders.


    ### Use Delegates App

    Delegating tokens to a representative allows you to transfer your voting
    power to someone who will actively participate in Token House governance on
    your behalf. By doing so, you retain 100% ownership of your tokens and can
    use them as you wish. To delegate your tokens, you can visit the [delegates
    app](https://app.optimism.io/delegates) and follow the instructions
    provided. It is important to note that delegate voting power is measured at
    the start of every voting period, which occurs every five weeks.


    ### Delegate Communications Thread

    Once you have delegated your tokens, your chosen delegate should provide
    reasoning behind their votes in a [Delegate Communications
    Thread](https://gov.optimism.io/c/governance/41). This thread serves as a
    platform for delegates to explain their decision-making process and engage
    with the community. By reviewing these communications, you can stay informed
    about the actions and decisions made on your behalf.

    If you choose not to assign your voting authority to another delegate, you
    will still have to delegate your vote to your own address in order to
    participate in the voting process:


    ### Register Yourself

    If you prefer not to delegate your voting power to a representative, you
    have the option to delegate to yourself. By following the [delegate
    commitment template](https://gov.optimism.io/t/delegate-commitments/235) on
    the [Optimism Governance Portal](https://vote.optimism.io/), you can
    register as a delegate and retain full control over your voting power. 


    ### Use Delegates App

    After completing the process, visit the delegates app to confirm that you
    have successfully delegated your tokens to your own address.


    ### Start Voting 

    Once you have been added as a delegate in the next voting cycle, you can
    start voting on governance matters.
