    ### Importance of Delegation


    Participating in the governance of the Optimism Token House can be a
    time-consuming task. To address this, individuals have the option to
    delegate their voting power to a community member who has volunteered to
    actively participate in Token House governance. However, if you prefer not
    to delegate your voting power, you will still need to delegate to yourself
    in order to vote. Let's explore the process of delegating tokens:


    When trying to delegate your votes to a representative, follow this process:


    ### Choosing Your Delegate

    Delegating your voting power is a crucial decision, so it is essential to
    take the time to read through delegate statements of interest. These
    statements provide insights into the delegate's stance on various governance
    matters. By carefully considering these statements, you can select a
    delegate who aligns with your values and priorities. Remember, a healthy
    governance system benefits both Optimism and all OP token holders.


    ### Use Delegates App

    Delegating tokens to a representative allows you to transfer your voting
    power to someone who will actively participate in Token House governance on
    your behalf. By doing so, you retain 100% ownership of your tokens and can
    use them as you wish. To delegate your tokens, you can visit the [delegates
    app](https://app.optimism.io/delegates) and follow the instructions
    provided. It is important to note that delegate voting power is measured at
    the start of every voting period, which occurs every five weeks.


    ### Delegate Communications Thread

    Once you have delegated your tokens, your chosen delegate should provide
    reasoning behind their votes in a [Delegate Communications
    Thread](https://gov.optimism.io/c/governance/41). This thread serves as a
    platform for delegates to explain their decision-making process and engage
    with the community. By reviewing these communications, you can stay informed
    about the actions and decisions made on your behalf.

    If you choose not to assign your voting authority to another delegate, you
    will still have to delegate your vote to your own address in order to
    participate in the voting process:


    ### Register Yourself

    If you prefer not to delegate your voting power to a representative, you
    have the option to delegate to yourself. By following the [delegate
    commitment template](https://gov.optimism.io/t/delegate-commitments/235) on
    the [Optimism Governance Portal](https://vote.optimism.io/), you can
    register as a delegate and retain full control over your voting power. 


    ### Use Delegates App

    After completing the process, visit the delegates app to confirm that you
    have successfully delegated your tokens to your own address.


    ### Start Voting 

    Once you have been added as a delegate in the next voting cycle, you can
    start voting on governance matters.

    ### Funding Sources in the OP Economy


    The funding for the OP economy comes from the ownership of OP Mainnet and
    the value of its blockspace. Currently, funding is obtained through the
    centralized sequencer, which is then redistributed by The Optimism
    Foundation. However, in the future, funding can be obtained by selling the
    right to participate in Optimism's decentralized sequencing network. This
    sustainable revenue source ensures the growth and sustainability of the OP
    economic model.


    Many markets fail to adequately fund and support public goods. Optimism
    addresses this issue by integrating a sustainable funding source into the
    network itself. Retroactive Public Goods Funding (RetroPGF) plays a crucial
    role in distributing sequencer revenue back to the ecosystem. This
    incentivizes individuals to contribute to the public good of the Optimism
    Collective. The Citizens' House, through voting, determines the distribution
    of funds to individuals, teams, projects, or communities that have made a
    positive impact.


    The Foundation expects RetroPGF to drive a wide range of downstream effects,
    benefiting the entire Optimism Collective. This mechanism not only funds
    public goods but also provides exit liquidity for early investment in these
    projects. By creating conditions for experimentation, the Foundation aims to
    maximize the long-term value for builders, users, tokenholders, citizens,
    and the entire Optimism Collective.


    The Optimism Collective operates on the belief that a healthy ecosystem is
    built on robust public goods. The economics of this ecosystem are designed
    to generate value for three key groups: tokenholders, contributors and
    builders, and users and community members:

    </div>


    ### Tokenholders

    Tokenholders benefit from the productive re-deployment of sequencer revenue.
    This revenue is primarily directed towards funding public goods, which not
    only creates value for the ecosystem but also drives demand for blockspace.
    As the network grows, the value of tokenholder investments increases.


    ### Contributors & Builders

    Contributors and builders play a crucial role in the Optimism Collective.
    They receive direct benefits from retroactive public goods funding and the
    markets it enables. Additionally, they benefit from a well-funded ecosystem
    that provides them with the necessary tools, education, apps, and
    infrastructure to build and thrive.


    ### Users & Community Members

    Users and community members also reap the rewards of the OP ecosystem. They
    receive ongoing airdrops of OP tokens, project incentives made possible by
    OP ecosystem funding, and the overall benefits that public goods provide.
    This creates a symbiotic relationship where the community members contribute
    to the ecosystem's growth and, in turn, benefit from its success.
