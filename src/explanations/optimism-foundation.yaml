  shortTitle: Work Processes
  details: >-
    The Optimism Foundation operates under a well-defined structure and set of
    processes to ensure effective governance and accountability. Let's take a
    closer look at the foundation's work processes and how they contribute to
    its smooth functioning:


    ### Governing Body

    The foundation is governed by a Board of Directors, which currently consists
    of Abbey Titcomb, Ben Jones, Brian Avello, Eva Beylin, and Jing. The board's
    primary role is to manage the foundation's business and affairs. They
    oversee the foundation's directors and ensure that they fulfill their legal
    obligations. Additionally, a supervisor is appointed to provide guidance and
    support to the board.

    </div>


    ### Employment

    To execute its operational and administrative aims, the foundation employs
    officers, contractors, and service providers. These individuals and entities
    play a crucial role in carrying out the day-to-day tasks and
    responsibilities of the foundation. They work closely with the board and
    other stakeholders to ensure the smooth functioning of the foundation.


    ### Legal Accountability

    As a Cayman Islands foundation company, the Optimism Foundation is legally
    accountable to its governing documentation. This documentation establishes
    the foundation's commitment to defer to the will of the Optimism Collective
    and its governance. The foundation is required to observe and implement the
    outcome of valid governance votes diligently and in a commercially
    reasonable manner. However, the foundation's discretion is limited to
    proposals that are unsafe, insecure, inconsistent with its purpose, legally
    non-compliant, or would hinder its ability to function effectively.

  shortTitle: Governance Proposals
  details: >-
    To ensure accountability and transparency, the foundation has implemented
    three governance proposal types. These proposals are designed to protect the
    rights of OP token holders and maintain transparency within the
    organization. By having these proposals in place, the foundation aims to
    align its financial resources with the collective's interests and
    priorities:


    ### Vote for Disbursement

    The foundation's financial resources are subject to an annual vote. This
    means that the amount of OP tokens available for disbursement are determined
    through a vote by the collective. By involving the collective in this
    decision-making process, the foundation ensures that its financial resources
    are allocated in a manner that aligns with the interests and priorities of
    the token holders.

    </div>


    ### Director Removal

    The governance has the authority to remove any member of the foundation's
    Board of Directors from service. This power is crucial in holding board
    members accountable for their actions and decisions. It allows for the
    removal of any director who fails to fulfill their responsibilities or acts
    against the best interests of the foundation. By having this authority, the
    governance ensures that the board members are held to a high standard and
    that their actions are in line with the foundation's goals.


    ### Power to Veto

    The Token House, representing the OP token holders, has the power to veto
    any proposed changes to the foundation's governing documents that would
    significantly reduce the rights of OP token holders. This mechanism serves
    as a safeguard for the interests and rights of the token holders. It ensures
    that their voices are heard and respected, and that any changes to the
    governing documents are in line with their best interests. By giving the
    Token House this power, the foundation demonstrates its commitment to
    protecting the rights of the token holders.

    ### Foundation Missions

    Foundation Missions are projects that the Optimism Foundation wants to
    undertake to further their goals. These missions are pre-specified by the
    foundation and are designed to address specific challenges or opportunities.
    They are supported by the Partner Fund, which means that the funding for
    these missions comes from external sources and not from the Governance Fund.
    The foundation carefully selects which proposals will be chosen to complete
    each mission, ensuring that they align with their vision and objectives.


    The following are the types of Collective Trust Tiers which are the very
    first step towards establishing a connection between oneâ€™s positive impact
    in the ecosystem and access to different types of work, grants, and roles
    within the Collective:


    <div align="center">
      <img style="max-height:400px;margin-bottom:30px" src="https://d31h13bdjwgzxs.cloudfront.net/academy/optimism-university/Guide/getting_your_project_funded_optimism_university_587/1695665351662_untitled-2023-09-25-1547.png"/>
    </div>


    If you are interested in contributing to a Foundation Mission, you can find
    an open mission on the list provided by the Optimism Foundation. Each
    mission will have a specified submission and selection deadline, so make
    sure to take note of these dates. To apply, you can simply reply as a
    comment on the [RFP's Github
    Issue](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ecosystem-contributions/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+RFP),
    providing your application and any relevant information. While the Token
    House, a governing body, does not vote on Foundation Missions, they have
    visibility into all RFP applications, ensuring transparency and
    accountability.


    ### Partner Fund


    The Partner Fund, managed by the Optimism Foundation, is a grants program
    aimed at providing strategic and larger scale grants to partners who have
    already achieved product market fit. The primary objective of the Partner
    Fund is to foster the growth of Optimism's ecosystem for the benefit of the
    entire Collective.


    The Partner Fund primarily focuses on projects that have already
    demonstrated success in the crypto space and are now looking to deploy and
    scale on the Optimism platform. These projects can be related to various
    areas of work, including Defi, NFTs, DAOs, and large scale usage growth for
    the ecosystem. By supporting these projects, the Partner Fund aims to build
    a thriving ecosystem for developers and users alike.


    The structure of the grants falls under these two categories:


    <div align="center">
      <img style="max-height:400px;margin-bottom:30px" src="https://d31h13bdjwgzxs.cloudfront.net/academy/optimism-university/Guide/getting_your_project_funded_optimism_university_587/1695839185908_untitled-2023-09-21-1651.png"/>
    </div>


    **User Incentives:** Grants provided by the fund are directly distributed to
    users of the project on the Optimism ecosystem. This can be in the form of
    liquidity mining, rewards, or other user incentives. By directly involving
    the users, the Partner Fund ensures that the grants have a meaningful impact
    on the growth and adoption of the projects.


    **Project Grants:** Projects that receive a grant from the Partner Fund,
    there is a 1-year token lockup period. This means that the granted tokens
    cannot be immediately sold or transferred. Instead, they can be used to
    support the operational costs of the project. This lockup period ensures
    that the granted tokens are utilized in a way that aligns with the long-term
    objectives of the Optimism ecosystem.


    It's important to note that the Optimism Foundation receives a large number
    of applications for the Partner Fund and can only support a select few that
    align with its objectives. Anyone can apply by simply filling out the
    [form](https://airtable.com/shrvQNlFPHGcVNqDe?prefill_Referrer=OPGov). There
    are no deadlines, applications are processed on a rolling basis
