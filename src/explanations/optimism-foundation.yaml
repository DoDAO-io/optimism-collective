    The Optimism Foundation operates under a well-defined structure and set of
    processes to ensure effective governance and accountability. Let's take a
    closer look at the foundation's work processes and how they contribute to
    its smooth functioning:


    ### Governing Body

    The foundation is governed by a Board of Directors, which currently consists
    of Abbey Titcomb, Ben Jones, Brian Avello, Eva Beylin, and Jing. The board's
    primary role is to manage the foundation's business and affairs. They
    oversee the foundation's directors and ensure that they fulfill their legal
    obligations. Additionally, a supervisor is appointed to provide guidance and
    support to the board.

    ### Employment

    To execute its operational and administrative aims, the foundation employs
    officers, contractors, and service providers. These individuals and entities
    play a crucial role in carrying out the day-to-day tasks and
    responsibilities of the foundation. They work closely with the board and
    other stakeholders to ensure the smooth functioning of the foundation.


    ### Legal Accountability

    As a Cayman Islands foundation company, the Optimism Foundation is legally
    accountable to its governing documentation. This documentation establishes
    the foundation's commitment to defer to the will of the Optimism Collective
    and its governance. The foundation is required to observe and implement the
    outcome of valid governance votes diligently and in a commercially
    reasonable manner. However, the foundation's discretion is limited to
    proposals that are unsafe, insecure, inconsistent with its purpose, legally
    non-compliant, or would hinder its ability to function effectively.

  details: >-
    To ensure accountability and transparency, the foundation has implemented
    three governance proposal types. These proposals are designed to protect the
    rights of OP token holders and maintain transparency within the
    organization. By having these proposals in place, the foundation aims to
    align its financial resources with the collective's interests and
    priorities:


    ### Vote for Disbursement

    The foundation's financial resources are subject to an annual vote. This
    means that the amount of OP tokens available for disbursement are determined
    through a vote by the collective. By involving the collective in this
    decision-making process, the foundation ensures that its financial resources
    are allocated in a manner that aligns with the interests and priorities of
    the token holders.

    ### Director Removal

    The governance has the authority to remove any member of the foundation's
    Board of Directors from service. This power is crucial in holding board
    members accountable for their actions and decisions. It allows for the
    removal of any director who fails to fulfill their responsibilities or acts
    against the best interests of the foundation. By having this authority, the
    governance ensures that the board members are held to a high standard and
    that their actions are in line with the foundation's goals.


    ### Power to Veto

    The Token House, representing the OP token holders, has the power to veto
    any proposed changes to the foundation's governing documents that would
    significantly reduce the rights of OP token holders. This mechanism serves
    as a safeguard for the interests and rights of the token holders. It ensures
    that their voices are heard and respected, and that any changes to the
    governing documents are in line with their best interests. By giving the
    Token House this power, the foundation demonstrates its commitment to
    protecting the rights of the token holders.
