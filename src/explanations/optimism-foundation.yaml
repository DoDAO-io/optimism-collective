  details: >-
    The Optimism Foundation operates under a well-defined structure and set of
    processes to ensure effective governance and accountability. Let's take a
    closer look at the foundation's work processes and how they contribute to
    its smooth functioning:


    ### Governing Body

    The foundation is governed by a Board of Directors, which currently consists
    of Abbey Titcomb, Ben Jones, Brian Avello, Eva Beylin, and Jing. The board's
    primary role is to manage the foundation's business and affairs. They
    oversee the foundation's directors and ensure that they fulfill their legal
    obligations. Additionally, a supervisor is appointed to provide guidance and
    support to the board.

    ### Employment

    To execute its operational and administrative aims, the foundation employs
    officers, contractors, and service providers. These individuals and entities
    play a crucial role in carrying out the day-to-day tasks and
    responsibilities of the foundation. They work closely with the board and
    other stakeholders to ensure the smooth functioning of the foundation.


    ### Legal Accountability

    As a Cayman Islands foundation company, the Optimism Foundation is legally
    accountable to its governing documentation. This documentation establishes
    the foundation's commitment to defer to the will of the Optimism Collective
    and its governance. The foundation is required to observe and implement the
    outcome of valid governance votes diligently and in a commercially
    reasonable manner. However, the foundation's discretion is limited to
    proposals that are unsafe, insecure, inconsistent with its purpose, legally
    non-compliant, or would hinder its ability to function effectively.
