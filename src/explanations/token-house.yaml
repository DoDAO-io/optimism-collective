    A Token House governance proposal is considered valid when it meets specific
    criteria related to the number of votes:


    ### Quorum

    This refers to the minimum number of total OP votes, which includes abstain
    votes, that must be cast for a proposal to be eligible. Quorum is calculated
    as a percentage of the total votable OP supply at the start of the voting
    period. The "votable supply" encompasses the OP tokens that have been
    delegated and are eligible to participate in the voting process. 


    ### Approval Threshold

    To approve a proposal, a minimum number of OP votes must be in favor of it.
    The approval threshold for each proposal is determined as a percentage of
    the votes cast in favor of approval relative to the total number of yes and
    no votes. Abstain votes are not included in this calculation.


    The table below showcases different requirements for submission and approval
    of each proposal type:

    ### Seasons & Voting Cycles


    Seasons are distinct periods of governance operations, each with its own
    unique timeline and objectives. These seasons are organized and scheduled to
    facilitate decision-making and governance within the Token House ecosystem. 


    Voting cycles are specific phases within a season during which token holders
    participate in the governance process. These cycles typically last for five
    weeks and serve as the primary periods for proposing, discussing, and voting
    on governance proposals. 


    These cycles commence on Thursday at 19:00 GMT (12:00 PST) and conclude on
    Wednesday at 19:00 GMT (12:00 PST). It is during these cycles that the
    community actively participates in voting on various proposals.

    Reflection Periods and Special Voting Cycles are integral parts of the
    governance system that the Optimism Foundation follows. These cycles allow
    for the adoption of proposals and the modification of the collective's
    structure based on feedback received during the previous season. Let's delve
    deeper into how these cycles work.


    ### Reflection Periods

    Reflection Periods play a crucial role in the governance process. During
    these periods, the Optimism Foundation publishes a proposed changelog to the
    Operating Manual and a set of governance proposals. These proposals aim to
    address the feedback received in the previous season, ensuring that the
    collective's decisions align with the community's needs.


    To allow delegates and the broader community ample time to provide critical
    feedback and suggestions for improvement, there are no active votes during
    Reflection Periods. This period serves as a dedicated time for reflection
    and constructive discussions, enabling the community to contribute to the
    enhancement of the upcoming season.


    ### Special Voting Cycles

    Following the Reflection Periods, Special Voting Cycles are conducted. These
    cycles focus specifically on voting for proposals that aim to modify the
    collective's structure. It is during these cycles that the changes made
    during the Reflection Period are voted upon. This ensures that the
    collective's structure remains adaptable and responsive to the evolving
    needs of the community.


    To stay up to date with the seasons and voting cycles, the governance
    calendar provides all the necessary information. It serves as a valuable
    resource for the community, offering insights into the timing and
    progression of the governance process.
