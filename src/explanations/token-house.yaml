    A Token House governance proposal is considered valid when it meets specific
    criteria related to the number of votes:


    ### Quorum

    This refers to the minimum number of total OP votes, which includes abstain
    votes, that must be cast for a proposal to be eligible. Quorum is calculated
    as a percentage of the total votable OP supply at the start of the voting
    period. The "votable supply" encompasses the OP tokens that have been
    delegated and are eligible to participate in the voting process. 


    ### Approval Threshold

    To approve a proposal, a minimum number of OP votes must be in favor of it.
    The approval threshold for each proposal is determined as a percentage of
    the votes cast in favor of approval relative to the total number of yes and
    no votes. Abstain votes are not included in this calculation.


    The table below showcases different requirements for submission and approval
    of each proposal type:
