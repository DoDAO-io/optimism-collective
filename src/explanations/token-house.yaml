    A Token House governance proposal is considered valid when it meets specific
    criteria related to the number of votes:


    ### Quorum

    This refers to the minimum number of total OP votes, which includes abstain
    votes, that must be cast for a proposal to be eligible. Quorum is calculated
    as a percentage of the total votable OP supply at the start of the voting
    period. The "votable supply" encompasses the OP tokens that have been
    delegated and are eligible to participate in the voting process. 


    ### Approval Threshold

    To approve a proposal, a minimum number of OP votes must be in favor of it.
    The approval threshold for each proposal is determined as a percentage of
    the votes cast in favor of approval relative to the total number of yes and
    no votes. Abstain votes are not included in this calculation.


    The table below showcases different requirements for submission and approval
    of each proposal type:

    ### Seasons & Voting Cycles


    Seasons are distinct periods of governance operations, each with its own
    unique timeline and objectives. These seasons are organized and scheduled to
    facilitate decision-making and governance within the Token House ecosystem. 


    Voting cycles are specific phases within a season during which token holders
    participate in the governance process. These cycles typically last for five
    weeks and serve as the primary periods for proposing, discussing, and voting
    on governance proposals. 


    These cycles commence on Thursday at 19:00 GMT (12:00 PST) and conclude on
    Wednesday at 19:00 GMT (12:00 PST). It is during these cycles that the
    community actively participates in voting on various proposals.

    </div>


    Reflection Periods and Special Voting Cycles are integral parts of the
    governance system that the Optimism Foundation follows. These cycles allow
    for the adoption of proposals and the modification of the collective's
    structure based on feedback received during the previous season. Let's delve
    deeper into how these cycles work.


    ### Reflection Periods

    Reflection Periods play a crucial role in the governance process. During
    these periods, the Optimism Foundation publishes a proposed changelog to the
    Operating Manual and a set of governance proposals. These proposals aim to
    address the feedback received in the previous season, ensuring that the
    collective's decisions align with the community's needs.


    To allow delegates and the broader community ample time to provide critical
    feedback and suggestions for improvement, there are no active votes during
    Reflection Periods. This period serves as a dedicated time for reflection
    and constructive discussions, enabling the community to contribute to the
    enhancement of the upcoming season.


    ### Special Voting Cycles

    Following the Reflection Periods, Special Voting Cycles are conducted. These
    cycles focus specifically on voting for proposals that aim to modify the
    collective's structure. It is during these cycles that the changes made
    during the Reflection Period are voted upon. This ensures that the
    collective's structure remains adaptable and responsive to the evolving
    needs of the community.


    To stay up to date with the seasons and voting cycles, the governance
    calendar provides all the necessary information. It serves as a valuable
    resource for the community, offering insights into the timing and
    progression of the governance process.

    ### Grants Council


    The Grants Council, elected by the Token House community, plays a crucial
    role in providing small to medium-sized grants to support various
    initiatives. These grants are divided into three categories: Builders,
    Experiments, and Requests for Grants (RFGs):


    <div align="center">
      <img style="max-height:400px;margin-bottom:30px" src="https://d31h13bdjwgzxs.cloudfront.net/academy/optimism-university/Guide/getting_your_project_funded_optimism_university_587/1695664570939_untitled-2023-09-25-1547.png"/>
    </div>


    **Builders grants** aim to maximize the number of builders, including
    developers and visionaries, who are building innovative applications on
    Optimism. The Council is particularly interested in projects that align with
    their mission of advancing the Builders community. When reviewing proposals,
    the Council looks for information that demonstrates how the project
    contributes to this mission.


    **Experiments grants** are designed to promote the adoption of novel
    applications and tangible use cases on Optimism. Unlike Builders grants,
    these grants are intended to reach end users and are not for the use of the
    proposer. The proposal forms for Experiments grants are specifically
    designed to gather information on how the project will expand the reach of
    the Optimism ecosystem and enhance the adoption of useful applications.


    **Requests for Grants (RFGs)** represent a transitional moment in the grant
    process. These grants are based on the needs of the Optimism ecosystem and
    are issued as requests for teams to submit proposals that address the most
    pressing problems. The Council specifies the requirements for each request,
    including how to submit a proposal and how the proposals will be assessed.
    The RFG process is dynamic and may be updated periodically.


    The Grants Council follows a five-week cycle during regular Voting Cycles to
    process applications. It is important to refer to the [governance
    calendar](https://calendar.google.com/calendar/u/0?cid=Y19mbm10Z3VoNm5vbzZxZ2JuaTJncGVyaWQ0a0Bncm91cC5jYWxlbmRhci5nb29nbGUuY29t)
    for the schedule and deadlines. 



    The following diagram showcases the procedure to submit a proposal:

    </div>



    ### Token House Missions


    The Token House plays a crucial role in the Optimism Collective by voting on
    approving Missions. These Missions are specific initiatives that align with
    the Collective Intents and can receive grants. You can propose a Mission
    under Intent #1, Intent #3, or Intent #4. All proposals under Intent #2
    should be grant applications that will be processed by the Grants Council.
    The Token House votes on these Missions once per Season, which is roughly
    every four to six months. In Season 4, the Foundation has suggested Intent
    Budgets to align the community around Collective Intents. Let's explore the
    different Intents and their proposed budgets:


    <div align="center">
      <img style="max-height:400px;margin-bottom:30px" src="https://d31h13bdjwgzxs.cloudfront.net/academy/optimism-university/Guide/getting_your_project_funded_optimism_university_587/1695320088654_untitled-2023-09-20-1744.png"/>
    </div>



    One can apply by submitting a [Mission
    proposal](https://gov.optimism.io/t/proposed-mission-template/5882) on the
    forum requesting the grant amount that corresponds to their Trust Tier.
    Mission Proposals will be approval ranked by the Token House every six
    months.
