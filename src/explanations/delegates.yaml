    Participating in Token House governance can be a time-consuming task. To
    alleviate this burden, individuals have the option to delegate their voting
    power to community members who have volunteered to actively participate in
    Token House governance. However, being a delegate is not a responsibility to
    be taken lightly. Before deciding to become a delegate, it is crucial to
    understand the responsibilities and commitments that come with this role.
    Let's explore the steps to becoming a delegate and the expectations
    associated with it:


    ### Commit

    The first step towards becoming a delegate is to familiarize yourself with
    the delegate responsibilities. These responsibilities can be found on the
    [forum](https://gov.optimism.io/t/delegate-commitments/235) dedicated to
    Token House governance. It is essential to thoroughly read and comprehend
    these responsibilities to ensure that you are fully aware of what is
    expected from you as a delegate. Understanding these responsibilities will
    help you make an informed decision about whether or not you are ready to
    take on this role.

    ### Set up Profile

    Once you have familiarized yourself with the delegate responsibilities, the
    next step is to register as a delegate on the [Optimism Governance Portal
    (Optimism Agora)](https://vote.optimism.io/). This portal serves as the
    platform for Token House governance, and registering as a delegate will
    allow you to actively participate in the decision-making process. To
    register, you will need to complete the [delegate commitment
    form](https://gov.optimism.io/t/delegate-commitments/235) provided on the
    portal. This form will require you to provide relevant information and agree
    to fulfill your responsibilities as a delegate.


    While not mandatory, it is advisable to delegate your own OP tokens' voting
    power to yourself. By doing so, you retain control over your voting power
    and can actively participate in the decision-making process. Self-delegating
    ensures that your voice is heard and that you have a say in the governance
    of Token House. However, it is important to note that token grants should
    not be self-delegated to grant recipients. This ensures fairness and
    prevents any conflicts of interest.
